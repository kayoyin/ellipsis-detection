Ellipsis (0 = no, 1 = yes)	English sentence																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	By the end of this year, there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The one thing that all of them have in common is that they're going to die.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	While that might be a somewhat morbid thought, I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller, who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here's what he wrote in starting that out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He said, "" Here it is. I'm dead, and this is my last post to my blog.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer, then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive. "" Now, while as a journalist, Miller's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most, the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that's something completely different than anything that's been created by any previous generation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Consider a few stats for a moment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So when you think about your parents or your grandparents, at best they may have created some photos or home videos, or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely, years after we're gone.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist, so what I'd like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now we're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One of them actually, fittingly enough, found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Death: Adam?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	AO: Yeah.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime, even at the Organic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	AO: Who is this?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Death: Go to ifidie. net before it's too late.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what that service does, quite simply, is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones, complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But what I think comes next is far more interesting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who, back in March, demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think as machines' ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve, it's going to become possible to analyze an entire life's worth of content — the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts — that we're producing in such massive numbers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I think as that happens, it's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating and technology's ability to make sense of it all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter, to make some predictions as to what you might say next.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well right now, as you can see, the results can be somewhat comical.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You can imagine what something like this might look like five, 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Taking it a step further, MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Finally, think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States, where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will .i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think that's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we're producing and technology's ability to understand it both expand exponentially.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so, what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you very much.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects, done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We call ourselves Pors and Rao, and we live and work in India.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'd like to begin with my very first object, which I call "" The Uncle Phone. "" And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him, almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water, a pack of cigarettes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And as I grew up, it became worse and worse, And I started to think of it as a form of control.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But of course, I could never say anything, because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle, I made him "" The Uncle Phone. "" It's so long that it requires two people to use it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college, I started missing his commands.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage, type his email or command and pull the paper out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism, the way my uncle likes it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The next work is a sound - sensitive installation that we affectionately call "" The Pygmies. "" And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall, and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we had these panels on three walls of a room.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is how it works.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a video prototype.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And they do n't react to background sounds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You'll hear a train in moment that they do n't react to.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Noise) But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Whistling) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche, mood swings, personalities and so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is a very early prototype.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Of course, it got much better after that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we made them react to people, but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a video installation called "" The Missing Person. "" And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance, and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us, using a camera that could look at people in the room, track them and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	On the right side you can see my colleague Soren, who's actually in the space.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And on the left side, you'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a very early video, so we have n't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that, but that got refined pretty soon, later.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space, and we had one monitor, one on each wall.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And as people walked into the room, they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference: one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is a work called "" The Sun Shadow. "" And it was almost like a sheet of paper, like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust, and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it, thinking it was some crap laying around.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But as soon as they passed by, it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) So this work is a caricature of an upside - down man.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts, that it's sort of fallen into his hat, and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it's kind of constrained by that circle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because if that circle were n't there, and the floor was very even, it would start to wander about in the space.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there's no wires.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I'll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room, it activates this object.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it very slowly, over a few minutes, sort of painfully goes up, and then it gains momentum and it looks like it's almost about to fall.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is an important moment, because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it does n't really need it, because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this work was a real technical challenge for us, and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall, because if we made it in a way that it would topple over, then it would damage itself, and if it did n't fall enough, it would n't instill that fatalism, or that sense of wanting to go and help it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it's much faster.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's my colleague. He's let it go.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	But he does n't need to, because it manages to lift itself up on its own.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is a work that we were very intrigued with, working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it's at the scale of the night sky.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we wrapped this around a blob-like form, which is in the shape of a teddy bear, which was hanging from the ceiling.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear, which is very comforting and intimate.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space, and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is the last work, and a work in progress, and it's called "" Space Filler. "" Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room, and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we work with a lot of technology, but we do n't really love technology, because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And once a creature pops into our minds, it's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I love the Internet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's true.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Think about everything it has brought us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Think about all the services we use, all the connectivity, all the entertainment, all the business, all the commerce.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it's happening during our lifetimes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm pretty sure that one day we'll be writing history books hundreds of years from now. This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online, the generation that built something really and truly global.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But yes, it's also true that the Internet has problems, very serious problems, problems with security and problems with privacy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've spent my career fighting these problems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So let me show you something.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This here is Brain.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter - inch floppy disk infected by Brain. A.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the first virus we ever found for PC computers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we actually know where Brain came from.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We know because it says so inside the code.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let's take a look.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All right.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's the boot sector of an infected floppy, and if we take a closer look inside, we'll see that right there, it says, "" Welcome to the dungeon. "" And then it continues, saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And Basit and Amjad are first names, Pakistani first names.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Now, 1986.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now it's 2011.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's 25 years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So half a year ago, I decided to go to Pakistan myself.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is from the city of Lahore, which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here's a typical street view.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And here's the street or road leading to this building, which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I knocked on the door.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) You want to guess who opened the door?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Basit and Amjad; they are still there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) (Applause) So here standing up is Basit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Sitting down is his brother Amjad.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I asked them why.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I asked them how they feel about what they started.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So there is some sort of justice in the world after all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What I'm running here is a system that enables me to run age - old programs on a modern computer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So let me just mount some drives. Go over there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What we have here is a list of old viruses.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So let me just run some viruses on my computer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, let's go with the Centipede virus first.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you can see at the top of the screen, there's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know that you're infected because it actually shows up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash, invented in Russia in 1992.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Siren noise) And the last example, guess what the Walker virus does?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So it used to be fairly easy to know that you're infected by a virus, when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Today, they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Today, viruses are a global problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs, where we track virus infections worldwide.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web, we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses, how many new examples of malware we find every single day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here's the latest virus we've found, in a file called Server.exe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one, six seconds ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And if we just scroll around, it's just massive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's the last 20 minutes of malware every single day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So where are all these coming from then?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's gangs like — let's go to GangstaBucks.com.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So if you are a virus writer and you're capable of infecting Windows computers, but you do n't know what to do with them, you can sell those infected computers — somebody else's computers — to these guys.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And they'll actually pay you money for those computers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well there's multiple different ways, such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking, or keyloggers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Keyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view, and they record everything you type.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Same thing with every single password and so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But the thing that they're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because when you do purchases in online stores, you will be typing in your name, the delivery address, your credit card number and the credit card security codes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And here's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's the credit card number, that's the expiration date, that's the security code, and that's the name of the owner of the card.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Once you gain access to other people's credit card information, you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that, obviously, is a problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations: we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden, and his partner in crime, also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages, Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain, a U.S. citizen.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These guys were running an operation called I.M.U., a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They are both right now on the run.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Nobody knows where they are.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago, froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the amount of money online crime generates is significant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We know that online criminals are hiring programmers, hiring testing people, testing their code, having back - end systems with SQL databases.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, the Internet is international.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's why we call it the Internet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world, here's a video built by Clarified Networks, which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia, moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So you just ca n't shut these guys down.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They will switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world, using the fact that we do n't have the capability to globally police operations like this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, criminals who were n't capable of reaching us before can reach us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So how do you actually go around finding online criminals?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How do you actually track them down?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let me give you an example.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What we have here is one exploit file.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file, which contains an exploit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer, it actually takes over your computer and runs code.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, if you'll take a look at this image file — well there's the image header, and there the actual code of the attack starts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	You just have to believe me, it is, it is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we can go here and actually start decrypting it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I know, it does n't really look much different from the original.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But just keep staring at it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address: unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But even more interestingly, if we continue decrypting, we'll find this mysterious string, which says O600KO78RUS.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not used for anything.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So obviously I Googled for it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	I got zero hits; was n't there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I spoke with the guys at the lab.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs, and one of them mentioned, well, it ends in RUS like Russia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg, and through a long road, we eventually found this one particular website.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website, and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And on this blog, he blogs about his life, about his life in St. Petersburg — he's in his early 20s — about his cat, about his girlfriend.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And he drives a very nice car.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, this guy drives a Mercedes - Benz S600 V12 with a six - liter engine with more than 400 horsepower.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now that's a nice car for a 20 - something year - old kid in St. Petersburg.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How do I know about this car?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because he blogged about the car.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He actually had a car accident.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In downtown St. Petersburg, he actually crashed his car into another car.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And he put blogged images about the car accident — that's his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And if you actually take a look at the scene picture, you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now I'm not a lawyer, but if I would be, this is where I would say, "" I rest my case. "" (Laughter) So what happens when online criminals are caught?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well in most cases it never gets this far.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The vast majority of the online crime cases, we do n't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And even if we are able to find online criminals, quite often there is no outcome.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	The local police do n't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence, or for some reason we ca n't take them down.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	I wish it would be easier; unfortunately it is n't.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But things are also changing at a very rapid pace.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You've all heard about things like Stuxnet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's a Siemens S7-400 PLC, programmable logic [controller].																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is what runs our infrastructure.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is what runs everything around us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	PLC's, these small boxes which have no display, no keyboard, which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when Stuxnet infects one of these, that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because everything around us is being run by these.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, we have critical infrastructure.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You go to any factory, any power plant, any chemical plant, any food processing plant, you look around — everything is being run by computers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Everything is being run by computers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Everything is reliant on these computers working.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have become very reliant on Internet, on basic things like electricity, obviously, on computers working.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) (Applause) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted are n't there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity, thinking about backups, thinking about the things that actually matter.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now I told you — (Laughter) I love the Internet. I do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Think about all the services we have online.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Think about if they are taken away from you, if one day you do n't actually have them for some reason or another.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I see beauty in the future of the Internet, but I'm worried that we might not see that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) I've spent my life defending the Net, and I do feel that if we do n't fight online crime, we are running a risk of losing it all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have to do this globally, and we have to do it right now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What we need is more global, international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks, and even more importantly, we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime, but have n't yet done it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have to find the people with the skills, but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you very much.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The world is changing with really remarkable speed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you look at the chart at the top here, you'll see that in 2025, these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And if you look at the chart for 2050, it's projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy, and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Goldman Sachs projected 2027.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The post-crisis projection is 2020.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's just a decade away.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	First of all, it's a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people, which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And within a decade, it will have the largest economy in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country, rather than a developed country.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Secondly, for the first time in the modern era, the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very, very different civilizational roots.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize, they also westernize.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is an illusion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition, markets and technology.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	China is not like the West, and it will not become like the West.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It will remain in very fundamental respects very different.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now the big question here is obviously, how do we make sense of China?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How do we try to understand what China is?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large, is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms, using Western ideas.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	We ca n't.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like, just as a beginning.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The first is this: that China is not really a nation -state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Okay, it's called itself a nation - state for the last hundred years, but everyone who knows anything about China knows it's a lot older than this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring - state period — the birth of modern China.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty, still 2,000 years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China, which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now what is extraordinary about this is, what gives China its sense of being China, what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese, comes not from the last hundred years, not from the nation - state period, which is what happened in the West, but from the period, if you like, of the civilization - state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm thinking here, for example, of customs like ancestral worship, of a very distinctive notion of the state, likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family, social relationships like guanxi, Confucian values and so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These are all things that come from the period of the civilization - state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world, is shaped by its sense of civilization, its existence as a civilization - state, rather than as a nation -state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this: Of course we know China's big, huge, demographically and geographically, with a population of 1.3 billion people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What we often are n't really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic, and in many ways very decentralized.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You ca n't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing, even though we think this to be the case.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's never been the case.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is China, a civilization - state, rather than a nation -state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what does it mean?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'll give you two quick ones.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity, is the maintenance of Chinese civilization.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe: breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It divided, and it's remained divided ever since.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	China, over the same time period, went in exactly the opposite direction, very painfully holding this huge civilization, civilization - state, together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The second is maybe more prosaic, which is Hong Kong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One country, two systems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	 Window dressing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	When China gets its hands on Hong Kong, that wo n't be the case. "" Thirteen years on, the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We were wrong. Why were we wrong?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough, in nation - state ways.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Think of German unification, 1990.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What happened?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One nation, one system.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That is the nation - state mentality.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But you ca n't run a country like China, a civilization - state, on the basis of one civilization, one system.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It does n't work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response: one civilization, many systems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The Chinese have a very, very different conception of race to most other countries.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Do you know, of the 1.3 billion Chinese, over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race, the Han?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, this is completely different from the world's [other] most populous countries.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	India, the United States, Indonesia, Brazil — all of them are multiracial.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The Chinese do n't feel like that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	China is only multiracial really at the margins.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the question is, why?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well the reason, I think, essentially is, again, back to the civilization - state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A history of at least 2,000 years, a history of conquest, occupation, absorption, assimilation and so on, led to the process by which, over time, this notion of the Han emerged — of course, nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that, without the Han, China could never have held together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	They really believe in their own superiority, and they are disrespectful of those who are not.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Hence their attitude, for example, to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Or let me give you my third building block, the Chinese state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the reason for this is because — well, there are two reasons, I think.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy, because in our terms the Chinese certainly do n't have a democracy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the reason for this is, firstly, because the state in China is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative, the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization, of the civilization - state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the second reason is because, whereas in Europe and North America, the state's power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition, historically against the church, against other sectors of the aristocracy, against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years, the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's had no serious rivals.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The result, by the way, is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder, a stranger, certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained, the Chinese do n't see the state like that at all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually, as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family, but as the head of the family, the patriarch of the family.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	This is the Chinese view of the state — very, very different to ours.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here, in the Chinese context, is a new kind of paradigm, which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Know that China believes in the market and the state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, Adam Smith, already writing in the late 18th century, said, "" The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe. "" And, apart from the Mao period, that has remained more or less the case ever since.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The state is everywhere in China.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, it's leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo, depend in many ways on state patronage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Moreover, this is a very old state tradition, a very old tradition of statecraft.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, if you want an illustration of this, the Great Wall is one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	But this is another, this is the Grand Canal, which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It went for 1,114 miles, linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China, which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today, which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization - state, the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And yet we still insist, by and large, in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience, looking at it through Western eyes, using Western concepts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's kind of arrogant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best, and therefore we have the universal measure.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And secondly, it's ignorant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We refuse to really address the issue of difference.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	But it's not.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In many ways, it's the most parochial, because for 200 years, the West has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures, other civilizations.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because, at the end of the day, it could, if necessary by force, get its own way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world, in fact, which have been in a far weaker position, vis -a- vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West, because of the West's presence in those societies.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And therefore, they are, as a result, more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, take the question of East Asia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. — a third of the world's population lives there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now the largest economic region in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And I'll tell you now, that East Asianers, people from East Asia, are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid, to the present.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning, the Goldman Sachs chart.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What is happening is that, very rapidly in historical terms, the world is being driven and shaped, not by the old developed countries, but by the developing world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We've seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7, or the G8.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there are two consequences of this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	First, the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen, climate change conference.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Europe was not at the final negotiating table.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When did that last happen?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that is what is going to happen in the future.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the second implication is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence, become increasingly unfamiliar to us, because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with, or conversant with.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And at last, I'm afraid — take Europe; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large, I have to say, are ignorant, are unaware about the way the world is changing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Some people — I've got an English friend in China, and he said, "" The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion. "" Well, maybe that's true, maybe that's an exaggeration.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But there's another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future in its confidence.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Take the 19th century, for example.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But this, alas, is no longer true.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future, try China — there's old Confucius.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a railway station the likes of which you've never seen before.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It does n't even look like a railway station.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is the new [Wuhan] railway station for the high -speed trains.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Or take this: now this is an idea, but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here you have a megabus, on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It travels on rails down a suburban road, and the cars travel underneath it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now this is the way things are going to move, because China has a very specific problem, which is different from Europe and different from the United States: China has huge numbers of people and no space.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is a solution to a situation where China's going to have many, many, many cities over 20 million people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Okay, so how would I like to finish?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I want to argue, above all, a big-picture positive for this world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For 200 years, the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's what Europe and North America represented.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world's population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on, represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Civilizations and cultures, which had been ignored, which had no voice, which were not listened to, which were not known about, will have a different sort of representation in this world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As humanists, we must welcome, surely, this transformation, and we will have to learn about these civilizations.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea, the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The little boat in front of it was the one in which, 80 years later, Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Or, look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think they're playing golf.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Christ, the Chinese even invented golf.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Welcome to the future. Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm here today to start a revolution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now before you get up in arms, or you break into song, or you pick a favorite color, I want to define what I mean by revolution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	By revolution, I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We need a revolution because things are n't working; they're just not working.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that makes me really sad because I'm sick and tired of things not working.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm sick and tired of us being last.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we are last place in so many things — for example, social factors.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're last place in Europe in innovation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There we are right at the end, right at the bottom, last place as a culture that does n't value innovation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're last place in health care, and that's important for a sense of well - being.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there we are, not just last in the E.U., we're last in Europe, at the very bottom.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And worst of all, it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're the saddest place on Earth, relative to GDP per capita — the saddest place on Earth.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's social. Let's look at education.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Last in reading, math and science. Last.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Business: The lowest perception in the E.U.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why as a result, what happens?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We hire the most people; we create the most taxes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So if our engine's broken, guess what?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Last in Europe GDP per capita.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Last.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're unhappy, we have bad education, and we have the worst businesses.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And these are facts, guys.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is n't story tale; it's not make - believe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	It's not.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I think it should be really, really clear that our system is broken.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The way we think, the way we behave, our operating system of behaving is broken.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better, for ourselves, for our friends, for our family and for our future.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How did this happen?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think we're last because — and this is going to be drastic to some of you — because we are handicapping ourselves.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're holding ourselves back because we do n't value play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I said "" play, "" all right.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Babies play, kids play, adults play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do n't value play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, we devalue play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we devalue it in three areas.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let's go back to the same three areas.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Social: 45 years of what?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing, inadvertently, creativity, individual self - expression and innovation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And instead, what do we value?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because it's shown the way we apply, generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context, which told us what in communism?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To be serious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To be really, really serious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	It did.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) Be serious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I ca n't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Heaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal, or even worse, lokvi, water — that will kill them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I have been told by babas and dyados that we should n't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have a serious meme running through.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a social gene running through us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a serious gene.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's 45 years of it that's created what I call the "" baba factor. "" (Laughter) (Applause) And here's how it works.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Step one: woman says, "" I want to have a baby. Iskam baby. "" Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But then what happens in step three?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to give bebko to baba.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But we need to remember that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what happens?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	She passes that virus on to baby, and it takes a really, really, really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What happens then?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years, that values rote learning, memorization and standardization, and devalues self - expression, self - exploration, questioning, creativity and play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a crap system.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	True story: I went looking for a school for my kid.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We went to this prestigious little school and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we said, "" Well what about play and recess? "" And they said, "" Ha. There wo n't be a single moment in the schedule. "" (Laughter) And we said, "" He's five. "" What a crime. What a crime.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we're creating mindless, robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I'm sorry, the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We need adaptability, the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do n't need mechanized workers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But no, now our meme goes into work where we do n't value play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We create robotic workers that we treat like assets, to lever and just throw away.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Autocratic — do what I say because I'm the chef.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm the boss and I know better than you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Untrusting — you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	(Laughter) Controlling — you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you do n't step out of the box.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So they're restrictive — do n't use your mobile phone, do n't use your laptop, do n't search the Internet, do n't be on I.M.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's somehow unprofessional and bad.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued and you're not having any fun.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In social, in education and in our business, do n't value play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's why we're last, because we do n't value play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you can say, "" That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It ca n't be because of play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Just play, that's a stupid thing. "" We have the serious meme in us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well I'm going to say no.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution, that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Play: our brains are hardwired for play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Evolution has selected, over millions and billions of years, for play in animals and in humans.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you know what?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Evolution does a really, really good job of deselecting traits that are n't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Nature is n't stupid, and it selected for play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Throughout the animal kingdom, for example: ants. Ants play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Maybe you did n't know that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But when they're playing, they're learning the social order and dynamics of things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Rats play, but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better, skills.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Kittens play. We all know kittens play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They can still hunt, but they ca n't be social.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Bears play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not the bears that learn how to fish better.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the ones that play more.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And a final really interesting study — it's been shown, a correlation between play and brain size.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The more you play, the bigger the brains there are.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Yours truly: humans.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Kids play, we play — of every nationality, of every race, of every color, of every religion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a universal thing — we play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it's not just kids, it's adults too.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Really cool term: neoteny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And who are the biggest neotenists?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Humans. We play sports.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We play musical instruments.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We dance, we kiss, we sing, we just goof around.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're designed by nature to play from birth to old age.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It is a huge benefit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Just like there's benefits to animals, there's benefits to humans.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, it's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala, in the area where it controls emotions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As a result, what happens?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We develop better decision - making ability if we play more.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These guys are facts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make - believe; it's cold, hard science.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These are the benefits to play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It is a genetic birthright that we have, like walking or speaking or seeing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And if we handicap ourselves with play, we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We hold ourselves back.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Little exercise just for a second: close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Imagine a world without theater, without the arts, without song, without dancing, without soccer, without football, without laughter.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What does this world look like?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's pretty bleak.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's pretty glum.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now imagine your workplace.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Is it fun? Is it playful?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we're forward thinking.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Is it fun? Is it playful?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling, restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have this concept that the opposite of play is work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work, or, "" Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He's going to think I'm not working hard. "" But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The opposite of play is not work. The opposite of play																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	is depression. It's depression.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, play improves our work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Just like there's benefits for humans and animals, there's benefits for play at work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, it stimulates creativity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It increases our openness to change.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It improves our ability to learn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity, through play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So before you start thinking of play as just not serious, play does n't mean frivolous.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing, he's serious about it, but he loves it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A doctor might be serious, but laughter's still a great medicine.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Our thinking is backwards.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We should n't be feeling guilty.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We should be celebrating play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Quick example from the corporate world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great, they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What happens? They give better service — not worse, but better.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled, how do the customers feel? They feel great.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what do great customers do, great - feeling customers?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends, which leads to more profit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	People, service, profit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Play increases productivity, not decreases.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you're going to say, "" Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States, but it ca n't work in Bulgaria.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	No way. We're different. "" It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One, play is universal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we ca n't play, besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When I got there, we had zero happy customers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Not one customer would refer us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I asked them all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We had marginal profit — I did.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We had marginal profits, and we had unhappy stakeholders.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Through some basic change, change like improving transparency, change like promoting self - direction and collaboration, encouraging collaboration, not autocracy, the things like having a results - focus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I do n't care when you get in in the morning. I do n't care when you leave.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I care that your customer and your team is happy and you're organized with that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Basically promoting fun.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Through promoting fun and a great environment, we were able to transform Sciant and, in just three short years — sounds like a long time, but change is slow — every customer, from zero to every customer referring us, above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you can say, "" Well how do you know they're happy? "" Well we did win, every year that we entered, one of the rankings for best employer for small business.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's nothing holding us back, except our own mentality about play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	First of all, you have to believe me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you do n't believe me, well just go home and think about it some more or something.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Second of all, if you do n't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you ca n't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I do n't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Rediscover that because you're the leaders, the innovation leaders, the thought leaders.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it, your colleagues, your employees, are n't going to feel it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You've got to go back and say, "" Hey, I'm going to trust you. "" Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you, and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to let you challenge authority.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because it's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're not always right as leaders.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're going to eradicate fear.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Fear is the enemy of play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we're going to do things like eliminate restrictions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know what, let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let them be on the Internet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let them be on instant messengers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let them take long lunches.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Lunch is like the recess for work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends, you have a beer, you have some food, you talk, you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you would n't have had before.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let them do it. Give them some freedom, and in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We spend so much of our lives at the workplace, and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind, so that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "" Is this it?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Is that all there was? "" Unacceptable. Nepriemliv.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) So in summary, we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave, but we do n't need a workers' revolution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do n't need a workers' revolution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What we need is a players' uprising. What we need is a players' uprising. What we need is a players' uprising.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Seriously, we need to band together. Today is the start of the uprising. But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution. You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	of what worked about reinvigorating our lives, our schools, and our work with play; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self - fulfillment; of how play promotes innovation and productivity, and, ultimately, how play creates meaning.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because we ca n't do it alone. We have to do it together, and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play, we can transform Bulgaria for the better.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I want to start by offering you a free no - tech life hack, and all it requires of you is this: that you change your posture for two minutes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter) I see you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, we're interested in, like, you know — (Laughter) — an awkward interaction, or a smile, or a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink, or maybe even something like a handshake.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Narrator: Here they are arriving at Number 10.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior, or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it's language, so we think about communication.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When we think about communication, we think about interactions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what nonverbals am I talking about?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice, and I teach at a competitive business school, so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So you make yourself big, you stretch out, you take up space, you're basically opening up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We make ourselves small.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is what happens when you put together high and low power.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I notice a couple of things about this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is really important in the MBA classroom, because participation counts for half the grade.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And here are the low - power poses.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is what happens.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's it. That's the whole experiment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here's what we find on testosterone.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here's what you get on cortisol.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Again, this is not about you talking to other people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So that's what we want to test. Okay?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	People hate this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart, and I had been called gifted as a child.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Like, she can fake it, she can become it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, this is two minutes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's what you want to do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Do n't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I did n't show them who I am.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom, make education seem like a bright idea.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation, or show that deprivation ai n't necessarily so.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Great creativity can make politicians electable, or parties unelectable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable, more magical. And now we need that magic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a time of need.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well: to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Narrator: And so he walked, and as he walked he saw things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Sure, she had aged a little.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, she had aged a lot.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But he felt all his old passion for her return.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	 Ford, "" he called softly. For that was her name.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	 Do n't say another word, Gusty, "" she said, for that was his name.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	 I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let's go there and make love. In the tent. "" Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The earth moved for both of them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And they lived together happily ever after.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And all because he decided to walk that day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The moral imperative is on the table.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Great creativity is needed to take it all, make it simple and sharp.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is a call, a plea, to the incredibly talented TED community.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let's get creative against climate change.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And let's do it soon. Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Beau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All you have to do is read what you see. Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, I'm going to count to you, so we do n't all do it together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Okay, one, two, three. Audience: Can you read this?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	BL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three. Audience: You are not reading this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	BL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter) If you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Audience: What are you reading?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	BL: What are you reading? There are no words there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I said, read what you're seeing. Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It literally says, "" Wat ar ou rea in? "" (Laughter) Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's because perception is grounded in our experience.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Right? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it, which means we never see what's there, we never see information, we only ever see what was useful to see in the past.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All right? Which means, when it comes to perception, we're all like this frog.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Right? It's getting information. It's generating behavior that's useful. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause) BL: And sometimes, when things do n't go our way, we get a little bit annoyed, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But we're talking about perception here, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And perception underpins everything we think, we know, we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear, falling in love, everything begins with perception.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means we're only ever responding according to what we've done before.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But actually, it's a tremendous problem, because how can we ever see differently?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently, and all new perceptions begin in the same way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They begin with a question.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The problem with questions is they create uncertainty.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Okay? (Laughter) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Right? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because it's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Your brain can not deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The question "" why? "" is one of the most dangerous things you can do, because it takes you into uncertainty.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately, evolution has given us an answer, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin, or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Right? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility, and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding, and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means is that we play to play. Play is its own reward.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now if you look at these five ways of being, these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Science is not defined by the method section of a paper.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true for anything that is creative.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So if you add rules to play, you have a game.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's actually what an experiment is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So armed with these two ideas, that science is a way of being and experiments are play, we asked, can anyone become a scientist?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And who better to ask than 25 eight - to 10 - year - old children?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently, but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The first step was to ask a question.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, I should say that we did n't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children could n't make a useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids could n't do it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we did it anyway. Right? Of course.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print so you would n't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	She was one of the young people who was involved in this study, and she's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage, will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, science and asking questions is about courage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now she is the personification of courage, because she's going to stand up here and talk to you all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So Amy, would you please come up? (Applause) (Applause) So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you the question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Amy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think, because we look alike.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But we wondered if there's a possible link with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar, since they seem so different from us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions. So what if bees can think like us?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	But it actually makes a lot of sense they should, because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather, or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause) BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment, and so — well, game — and so, Amy, can you tell us what the game was, and the puzzle that you set the bees?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if - then rule.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue, or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was completely new, and no one had done it before, including adults. (Laughter) BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing, because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was the collaborator on this project. Okay?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it, but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do — Student: 5C.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here? Student: Yeah.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Dave Strudwick: So you keep track of each. Student: Henry, can you help me here?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	BL: "" Can you help me, Henry? "" What good scientist says that, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Student: There's two up there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And three in here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	BL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And now we want to share. That's the next step.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication. Right? So we have to write it up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter) The one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter) Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections: an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The introduction says, what's the question and why?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the discussion is, who cares? Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's a science paper, basically. (Laughter) So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative, which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not written by me. It's written by Amy and the other students in the class. As a consequence, this science paper begins, "" Once upon a time... "" (Laughter) The results section, it says: "" Training phase, the puzzle... duh duh duuuuuhhh. "" Right? (Laughter) And the methods, it says, "" Then we put the bees into the fridge (and made bee pie), "" smiley face. Right? (Laughter) This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because if it were ever referenced, it would be "" Blackawton et al, "" and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal, and it says this. It said many things, but it said this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	 I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways. "" (Laughter) In other words, it starts off "" once upon a time, "" the figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter) So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves, who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world, and he says, "" This is the most original science paper I have ever read "" — (Laughter) — "and it certainly deserves wide exposure."																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "" The paper is magnificent.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The work would be publishable if done by adults. "" So what did we do? We send it back to the editor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They say no.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right, putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees, and it was published. Okay? (Applause) (Applause) It took four months to do the science, two years to get it published. (Laughter) Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What was the feedback like?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, it was published two days before Christmas, downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Last year, it was the second - most downloaded paper by Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'll just read one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	 I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I do n't have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What you guys have done is real, true and amazing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Curiosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Who else can have these qualities more than children?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Please congratulate your children's team from my side. "" So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Can I do it on you? (Laughter) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter) For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter) And you like technology, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now... (Laughter) Okay. (Laughter) Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You have to close your eyes, and you have to point where you hear me clapping. All right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Clapping) (Clapping) Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Audience: (Shouts) (Laughter) (Shouts) (Laughter) Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Everyone over there shout. (Shouts) Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) What's the point? The point is what science does for us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Right? We normally walk through life responding, but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes, he was able to see the world in a new way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice, so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, Amy?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	AO: This project was really exciting for me, because it brought the process of discovery to life, and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone, has the potential to discover something new, and that a small question can lead into a big discovery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person feels about change.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy. Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle, I then realized that science is n't just a boring subject, and that anyone can discover something new.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you. BL: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm not going to talk about "" The Skeptical Environmentalist "" — probably that's also a good choice.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So get out your pen and paper.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm just going to list some of them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are 800 million people starving.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's a billion people without clean drinking water.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Two billion people without sanitation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The lists go on and on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are many, many problems out there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we do n't.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do n't actually solve all problems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that's why it's on the economy session — is to say, if we do n't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves, which ones should we solve first?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's the question I'd like to ask you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world, where should we spend it?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world, and I will just briefly read them: climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education, financial instability, governance and corruption, malnutrition and hunger, population migration, sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The obvious question would be to ask, what do you think are the biggest things?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Where should we start on solving these problems?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But that's a wrong problem to ask.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because we ca n't solve problems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But we do n't have a technology to solve that, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the point is not to prioritize problems, but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To climate change that would be like Kyoto.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The point that I would like to ask you to try to do, is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And also — and that's, of course, where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do, first.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What should be at the bottom of the list?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor, and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world's biggest issues.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	The amazing part of this process — and of course, I mean, I would love to — I only have 18 minutes, I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process, and that's actually what we did.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I also strongly encourage you, and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards, to think about, how do we actually prioritize?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Of course, you have to ask yourself, why on Earth was such a list never done before?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Nobody wants to do this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And since there are many more not - number - one spots on the list than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years, yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world, and said, which of them should we do first?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So it does n't mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing, if only implicitly — and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization, and went in and talked about it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have, for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are many, many things we can do out there, but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have not had an idea.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card, but you have no idea what the price is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It could be a family - size pizza; it could be a very individual - size pizza, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We'd like to know these things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What can we do? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Likewise in communicable diseases.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What would be the price?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then we had some of the world's top economists, eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates, meet in Copenhagen in May 2004.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We called them the "" dream team. "" The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That works very well in Europe, but it does n't really work over here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And then you ask, why economists?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question — (Laughter) — because that's a very good question.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria, you ask a malaria expert.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first, you ca n't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That is what economists do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They prioritize.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first, and which one should we do afterwards?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Of course, you can also see it on the website, and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically, projects where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These were the bad projects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things where people will say I should n't come back, either.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why is it it came up?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not saying that global warming is not happening.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not saying that it's not a big problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little, at a very high cost.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models, is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's a substantial amount of money.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Yet it would do very little good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Which is a little good, but not very much good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And just to give you a sense of reference, the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount, for about 75 billion dollars a year, we could solve all major basic problems in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that is really why it becomes a bad project.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we would n't want to do it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it's to say, when we do n't, it's just simply not our first priority.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The fair projects — notice I'm not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services — just made it, simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Again, what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important, but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years, we could bring that incidence down to half.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We could avoid about 500,000 people dying, but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people getting infected every year.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This third best one was free trade.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade, and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year, half of which would accrue to the Third World.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty, very radically fast, in about two to five years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That would be the third best thing we could do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If we invest about 12 billion dollars, we could make a severe inroad into that problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That would be the second best investment that we could do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years, we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One is treatment; the other one is prevention.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But in a world where we do n't do either, or do n't do it very well, we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more by investing in prevention.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Basically for the amount of money that we spend, we can do X amount of good in treatment, and 10 times as much good in prevention.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment, at first rate.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say, did you get it right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Or did you get close to what we came up with here?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We should also do climate change, if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But of course, we do n't do all problems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are many problems out there in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems, that we focus on the right ones.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I think, actually — Thomas Schelling, one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years, when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be, people will be much, much richer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And of course, we'll be even richer than that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people, or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100, we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so the real point, of course, is to say, do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little, 100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh, who really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100, thinking back on 2005, and saying, "" How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change, and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more, and who needed the help so much more? "" So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Even if it does n't accord to the typical way we see this problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have, you know, "" The Day After Tomorrow "" — it looks great, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it, right, but do n't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter) It just does n't make for as much of a movie.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not about making things that have the most media attention, but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The other objections, I think, that are important to say, is that I'm somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Of course, we should do all things, in an ideal world — I would certainly agree.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	I think we should do all things, but we do n't.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Since then our aid has halved.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So it does n't look like we're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, we spend 100 billion dollars — why do n't we spend that on doing good in the world?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm all for that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	But the point, of course, is still to say, if you get another 100 billion dollars, we still want to spend that in the best possible way, do n't we?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, when you ask the world's best economists, you inevitably end up asking old, white American men.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And they're not necessarily, you know, great ways of looking at the entire world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university, and they spoke English.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The majority of them were, first, from developing countries.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did, to come up with their own lists.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We've done this many other times.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They all come out with very much the same list.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities, and saying, what is the important thing in the world?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But if we do n't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We did it in 2004, and we hope to assemble many more people, getting much better information for 2008, 2012.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To start thinking about saying, "" Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we do n't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now. "" At the end of the day, you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these, but we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we do n't do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If we worry too much about some things, we end by not worrying about other things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I hope this will help us make better priorities, and think about how we better work for the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But at this time, giving voice to the catadores.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	About a year and a half ago, Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth, brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps, which is Microsoft's online - mapping effort.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, as we zoom - in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City -like virtual view at 45 degrees.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, we see this space, this three - dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This wonderful one which I do n't have time to show you is taking hyper- local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's wonderful.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And so, when you fly down — (Applause) Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three - dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three - dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, I'll show you a fun app that — we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth - like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so — I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but — (Laughter) But notice — this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this one was taken around five.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So you really see how this kind of crowd - sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	OK, notice there's now a roof above us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're inside the Pike Place Market.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) OK.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Ringing) All right, guys, are you there?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm live. All right. There we go.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) So they're broadcasting this live.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because I want to show points of interest.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	No, no. The other way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I do n't want to see you guys yet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	OK, never mind.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What the hell are you guys — oh, sorry.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) We're doing two different — OK, I'm hanging up now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're doing two different things here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One of them is to take that real...																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you all very much.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So it's 1995, I'm in college, and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence, Rhode Island to Portland, Oregon.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you know, we're young and unemployed, so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota, I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My friend looks at me totally blankly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) And I'm like, "" You know, all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them. "" She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what I'm talking about is this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area. (Laughter)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us, and how we behave when that happens, and what all of this can tell us about human nature.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In other words, as you heard Chris say, I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This might strike you as a strange career move, but it actually has one great advantage: no job competition.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	(Laughter) In fact, most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong, or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We get it in the abstract.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The human species, in general, is fallible — okay fine.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But when it comes down to me, right now, to all the beliefs I hold, here in the present tense, suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I ca n't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We go to meetings in the present tense; we go on family vacations in the present tense; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life, trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think this is a problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what I want to do today is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And second, why it's such a problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And finally, I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So let me ask you guys something — or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here: How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Dreadful. Thumbs down.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing — thank you, these are great answers, but they're answers to a different question.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You guys are answering the question: How does it feel to realize you're wrong?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But just being wrong does n't feel like anything.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'll give you an analogy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In pretty much every episode of this cartoon, there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff, which is fine — he's a bird, he can fly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what's funny — at least if you're six years old — is that the coyote's totally fine too.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's when he falls.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When we're wrong about something — not when we realize it, but before that — we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It does feel like something to be wrong; it feels like being right.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I call this error blindness.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Most of the time, we do n't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something, until it's too late.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Think back for a moment to elementary school.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You're sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is not mine, by the way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker, the one who never does his homework.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So by the time you are nine years old, you've already learned, first of all, that people who get stuff wrong are lazy, irresponsible dimwits — and second of all, that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We learn these really bad lessons really well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And a lot of us — and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over -achievers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Right, Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Okay, so fine.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because according to this, getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So let me tell you a story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A couple of years ago, a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Beth Israel's in Boston.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Everything seems to have gone fine.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says, "" Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages? "" Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident, he said something very interesting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He said, "" For whatever reason, the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient. "" (Laughter) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is a huge practical problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it's also a huge social problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way, by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They do n't have access to the same information that we do, and when we generously share that information with them, they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When that does n't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when that does n't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is a catastrophe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The miracle of your mind is n't that you can see the world as it is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	It's that you can see the world as it is n't.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We can remember the past, and we can think about the future, and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we all do this a little differently, which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about "" I think therefore I am, "" this guy, St. Augustine, sat down and wrote "" Fallor ergo sum "" — "I err therefore I am."																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up, it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system, something we can eradicate or overcome.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's totally fundamental to who we are.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because, unlike God, we do n't really know what's going on out there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To me, this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Last year, for various reasons, I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so I'm listening and I'm listening, and at some point, I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And my first thought was, "" I've lost it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've become the crazy wrongness lady.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I just imagined it everywhere, "" which has happened.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I mentioned this to him, and he was like, "" No actually, that's true.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, "" he says, "" as a staff, we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the crypto-theme is: 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is, "" says Ira Glass, "" we need this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work. "" And for the rest of us, audience members, as listeners, as readers, we eat this stuff up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When it comes to our stories, we love being wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq, find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction, liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And something else happened instead.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life, until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And something else happened instead.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And something else happened instead.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And something else happened instead.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) I mean, this is life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For good and for ill, we generate these incredible stories about the world around us, and then the world turns around and astonishes us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	No offense, but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because half the stuff that's the most mind - boggling and world - altering — TED 1998 — eh.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Did n't really work out that way, did it? (Laughter)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Where's my jet pack, Chris? (Laughter)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) So here we are again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's how it goes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We come up with another idea.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We tell another story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We hold another conference.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The theme of this one, as you guys have now heard seven million times, is the rediscovery of wonder.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And to me, if you really want to rediscover wonder, you need to step outside of that tiny, terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say, "" Wow, I do n't know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Maybe I'm wrong. "" Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) Thank you guys. (Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm delighted to be here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in, but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in wo n't interest many other people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I would love to talk about my astronomy, but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non- gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I'm not going to talk about that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987, when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I caught the guys, and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB, and stealing information and selling it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'd love to talk about that — and it'd be fun — but, 20 years later...																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's tedious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm — The first time you do something, it's science.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The second time, it's engineering.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A third time, it's just being a technician.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, I'm not going to talk about that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book, "" Silicon Snake Oil, "" or my second book, nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers do n't belong in schools.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My idea is: no! No!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Get them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'd love to talk about this, but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom that it does n't need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that, and everything else that I've said.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So do n't go back and read my dissertation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It probably has lies in it as well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Having said that, I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) And if you look at it over here, the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre, because I've got gray hair, and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be, if you really want to know about the future, do n't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	No! Do n't ask somebody who's writing code.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	No, if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years, ask a kindergarten teacher.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, do n't ask just any kindergarten teacher, ask an experienced one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	I do n't. Nor, I suspect, do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Certainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But to me, things are n't the future.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like, when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on - screen time, but have never gone bowling together?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Change is happening, and the change that is happening is not one that is in software.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But that's not what I'm going to talk about.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun, but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oh — the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about is right over here. Right over here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Is that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one- sided things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops, but I'm one of the very few people, if not the only person in the world, that makes Klein bottles.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Right away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a Klein bottle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For those of you in the audience who know, you roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It has wonderful properties.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together, you get one of these, and I make them out of glass.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'd love to talk to you about this, but I do n't have much in the way of... things to say because — (Laughter) (Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.) However, the "" D "" in TED of course stands for design.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Just two weeks ago I made — you know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But what I've just made — and I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a Klein bottle wine bottle, which, although in four dimensions it should n't be able to hold any fluid at all, it's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions, it can hold fluids.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So it's highly — that one's the cool one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That was a month of my life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	But although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Instead, I'm going to mention my mom, who passed away last summer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Could somebody put this guy up?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me, standing — well, sitting — in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I looked at it, and said, oh my god, that was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As a technician, repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it sent me back.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Soon after that, I found in another picture that she had, a picture of me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This guy over here of course is me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This man is Robert Moog, the inventor of the Moog synthesizer, who passed away this past August.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Robert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A musician who took time from his life to teach me, a sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there — I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're studying physics, I'm studying physics, and he's saying, "" That's a good thing to do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Do n't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics. "" Mentoring me. He'd come up and spend hours and hours with me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	In the background, my bicycle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We sat around talking about Fourier transforms, Bessel functions, modulation transfer functions, stuff like this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do — I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave, almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett - Packard oscilloscope.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about — is that okay?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've decided that, for me at least, I do n't have a big enough head.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I think locally and I act locally.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say, "Well, how come you ai n't teaching?"																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I said, "" Well, I've taught graduate — I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes. "" No, they said, "" If you're so into kids and all this stuff, how come you ai n't over here on the front lines?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Put your money where you mouth is. "" Is true. Is true. I teach eighth - grade science four days a week.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Not just showing up every now and then.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	No, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I take lunch hour. (Applause) This is not — no, no, no, this is not claps.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Not just show up to class every now and then.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Teach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three - quarters time, but good enough.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One of the things that I've done for my science students is to tell them, "" Look, I'm going to teach you college - level physics.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	No calculus, I'll cut out that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You wo n't need to know trig.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But you will need to know eighth - grade algebra, and we're going to do serious experiments.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	None of this open- to-chapter - seven - and - do- all - the-odd -problem -sets.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're going to be doing genuine physics. "" And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(High -pitched tone) Oh, before I even turn that on, one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My students in El Cerrito — with my help, of course, and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope — measured the speed of light.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'd love to measure the speed of light here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was all set to do it and I was thinking, "" Aw man, "" I was just going to impose upon the powers that be, and measure the speed of light.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it, but then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there's no time to do it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But, probably — one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said, "Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?"																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave...																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	is a constant. When the frequency goes up, the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up, frequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here — over here, that's what's interesting — as the pitch goes up, things get closer, pitch goes down, things stretch out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Right? This is simple physics.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All of you know this from eighth grade, remember?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	What they did n't tell you in physics — in eighth - grade physics — but they should have, and I wish they had, was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light, you get a constant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that constant is the speed of sound.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, in order to measure the speed of sound, all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've got a frequency counter right here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, so I know the frequency.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All I need now is to flip on another beam, and the bottom beam is me talking, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source, you'll notice the spiral.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave, coming out this way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes, but bear with me. (Laughter) To measure the wavelength, all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	From here to here is the wavelength of sound.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	OK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The wavelength was 0.2 meters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let's figure out what this is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) (Applause) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you look it up in the book, it's really 343.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink — we've been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad. Pretty good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All of which comes to what I wanted to say.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Go back to this picture of me a million years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on, and I'm like, "" Oh my God! "" I'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's a riot going on on campus, and the police are chasing me, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says, "You! You're a student."																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Pulls out a gun. Goes boom!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I get a breath of tear gas and I ca n't breathe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This cop comes after me with a rifle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He wants to clunk me over the head!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm saying, "" I got to clear out of here! "" I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's one of these bell - tower buildings.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The cop's chasing me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Chasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Chases me into this room.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The entranceway to the bell tower.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I slam the door behind me, climb up, go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm thinking, "" Oh yeah, the square root of the length is proportional to its period. "" (Laughter) I keep climbing up, go back.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I go to a place where a dowel splits off.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I climb up, and there's this place, way in the back, that you climb up this wooden ladder.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I pop up the top, and there's a cupola.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A dome, one of these ten- foot domes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads, shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm asking, "" What am I doing here? Why am I here? "" Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Namely, that when they cast bells, they write inscriptions on them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm asking myself, "" Why am I here? "" So, at this time, I'd like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells: "" All truth is one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In this light, may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light, from narrowness to broad- mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn. "" Thank you very much.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Sustainability represents the what, the where and the how of what is caught.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The who and the why are what's important to me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I want to know how I impact them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I want to know how they impact me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I want to know why they fish.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what do we call this?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think we call it restorative seafood.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource, suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It is a more hopeful, it is a more human, and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The association is very easy: buy green, do n't buy red, think twice about yellow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But in my mind, it's really not enough to just eat green list.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We ca n't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But what if we eat only in the green list?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You've got pole - caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Pole caught — no bycatch.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What's the context of this meal?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16 - ounce portion of this?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Do I do this three times a week?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I might still be in the green list, but I'm not doing myself, or you, or the oceans any favors.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The point is that we have to have a context, a gauge for our actions in all this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's great! I love red wine!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well folks, we have a protein problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food, and we are paying a cost.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman, but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Vegetables: they might yet save the oceans.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We must continue to eat the best seafood possible, if at all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half - shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It comes in a five- ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy, grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Whooo!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is an easy sell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's a pattern here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Forget nuclear holocaust; it's the fork that we have to worry about.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so I think it's time we change what we expect from our food.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So let's start there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Just because it comes from a green source does n't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have eco-friendly shrimp.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We can make them; we have that technology.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But we can never have any eco- friendly all - you-can - eat shrimp buffet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It does n't work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	While we try to manage declining marine populations, the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it's not all about the seafood.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's about the way that we look at our plates.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A couple things happened.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I made more money.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	People started buying appetizers and salads, because they knew they were n't going to fill up on the entrees alone.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	People spent more time engaging in their meals, engaging with each other over their meals.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	People got, in short, more of what they came there for even though they got less protein.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They got healthier. I made more money.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is great.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Environmental consideration was served with every plate, but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Shellfish, mussels, oysters, clams, tilapia, char — these were the common species.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We were directing tastes towards more resilience, more restorative options.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is what we need to favor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is what the green list says.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But what of those big predators, those fashionable species, that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean, so here we go.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Start with a 16 - ounce portion of big fish.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Put it on four plates.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have, light the candles and celebrate it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year, maybe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I expect a lot from food.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I expect health and joy and family and community.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I expect that producing ingredients, preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I remember well the meals of my childhood.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch, usually rice.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is still how I largely eat today.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I get sick when I go to steakhouses.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I get the meat sweats.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's like a hangover from protein.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's disgusting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans, I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Eat your vegetables.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's pretty straightforward.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what are we looking for in a meal?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For family, I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For community though, we start at the very beginning.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We've seen an image of our blue planet, our world bank.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it is more than just a repository of our resources; it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So if we all take only what we need, then we can begin to share the rest, we can begin to celebrate, we can begin to restore.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We need to savor vegetables.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we need to save dinner.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Hi. I am an architect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube, and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	1986, much, much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues, I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	It's very complicated to test the new material for the building, but this is much stronger than I expected, and also it's very easy to waterproof, and also, because it's industrial material, it's also possible to fireproof.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then I built the temporary structure, 1990.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is the first temporary building made out of paper.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters], there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In case you're finished with toilet paper, you can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter) So it's very useful.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was asked to design the building, because the theme of the expo was environmental issues.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes, recyclable paper.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My goal of the design is not when it's completed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My goal was when the building was demolished, because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste, so my building has to be reused or recycled.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	After, the building was recycled.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So that was the goal of my design.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because I was so poor, I wanted to rent an office in Paris, but I could n't afford it, so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35 - meter-long office.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We stayed there for six years without paying any rent.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. I had one big problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because we were part of the exhibition, even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That was the problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a very popular museum now, and I created a big monument for the government.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect, because we are not helping, we are not working for society, but we are working for privileged people, rich people, government, developers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They have money and power.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Those are invisible.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That is our profession, even historically it's the same, even now we are doing the same.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society, even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, earthquakes never kill people, but collapse of the buildings kill people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's the responsibility of architects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then people need some temporary housing, but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I thought, even as architects, we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We can make it better.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So that is why I started working in disaster areas.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Over two million people became refugees.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp organized by the U.N.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're so poor, and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season, In the shelters built by the U.N., they were just providing a plastic sheet, and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But over two million people cut trees.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It just became big, heavy deforestation and an environmental problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Very expensive, they throw them out for money, then cutting trees again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong, but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites, so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan, we had a big earthquake.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Nearly 7,000 people were killed, and the city like this Nagata district, all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I went there and also I proposed to the priests, "Why do n't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And he said, "" Oh God, are you crazy?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	After a fire, what are you proposing? "" So he never trusted me, but I did n't give up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I started commuting to Kobe, and I met the society of Vietnamese people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I proposed to rebuild. I raised — did fundraising.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I made a paper tube shelter for them, and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish, I used beer crates as a foundation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I asked the Kirin beer company to propose, because at that time, the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red, which does n't go with the color of the paper tubes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The color coordination is very important.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And also I still remember, we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate, but it came empty. (Laughter) So I remember it was so disappointing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So during the summer with my students, we built over 50 units of the shelters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He said, "" As long as you collect money by yourself, bring your students to build, you can do it. "" So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was meant to stay there for three years, but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake, and we proposed to donate this church, so we dismantled them, we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this building became a permanent building.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake, I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China, nearly 70,000 people were killed, and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In one month, we completed nine classrooms, over 500 square meters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's still used, even after the current earthquake in China.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is a very interesting photo: former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso — you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And they are very kind, affording my model.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall, because L'Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed, so musicians were moving out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I proposed to the mayor, I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He said, "" As long as you bring your money, you can do it. "" And I was very lucky.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit, and our former prime minister came, so they helped us to collect money, and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake, but it's impossible to fly over, so I went to Santo Domingo, next - door country, to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	After the earthquake and tsunami, people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But look at this. There's no privacy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	People suffer mentally and physically.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes, just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	However, some of the facility authority does n't want us to do it, because, they said, simply, it's become more difficult to control them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it's really necessary to do it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They do n't have enough flat area to build standard government single - story housing like this one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Look at this. Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing, so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking, so I thought, we have to make multi-story building because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He asked me to build three - story housing on baseball [fields].																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable, within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same, but much more comfortable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Many of the people want to stay here forever.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was very happy to hear that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened, also they had a big earthquake, and many Japanese students were also killed, and the most important cathedral of the city, the symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is under construction.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'd like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you very much.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What is going on in this baby's mind?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you'd asked people this 30 years ago, most people, including psychologists, would have said that this baby was irrational, illogical, egocentric — that he could n't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So in some ways, we think that this baby's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let me give you just one example of this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One thing that this baby could be thinking about, that could be going on in his mind, is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel is n't actually exactly like what we think and feel.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now the question is: How could we ask them?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Babies, after all, ca n't talk, and if you ask a three year - old to tell you what he thinks, what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So how do we actually ask them the question?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What we did — Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food: one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now all of the babies, even in Berkley, like the crackers and do n't like the raw broccoli.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And she would act as if she liked it or she did n't.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and did n't like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But half the time, what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go, "" Mmmmm, broccoli.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm. "" And then she would take a little bit of the crackers, and she'd go, "" Eww, yuck, crackers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck. "" So she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We did this with 15 and 18 month - old babies.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And then she would simply put her hand out and say, "Can you give me some?"																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the question is: What would the baby give her, what they liked or what she liked?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the remarkable thing was that 18 month - old babies, just barely walking and talking, would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers, but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	On the other hand, 15 month - olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli, like they could n't figure this out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But then after they stared for a long time, they would just give her the crackers, what they thought everybody must like.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So there are two really remarkable things about this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The first one is that these little 18 month - old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature, that we do n't always want the same thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Even more remarkably though, the fact that 15 month - olds did n't do this suggests that these 18 month - olds had learned this deep, profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that's actually demonstrated it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The question you might ask though is: Why do children learn so much?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless, because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies, it turns out that there's actually an answer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates, but also including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	On one side is a New Caledonian crow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth, are incredibly smart birds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is a bird on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	On the other hand, we have our friend the domestic chicken.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So they're very, very good at pecking for grain, and they're not much good at doing anything else.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well it turns out that the babies, the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years, which is a really long time in the life of a bird.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Other creatures, like the crows, are n't very good at doing anything in particular, but they're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And of course, we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're smarter, we're more flexible, we can learn more, we survive in more different environments, we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My son is 23.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) And at least until they're 23, we're still popping those worms into those little open mouths.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All right, why would we see this correlation?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that one big disadvantage is that, until you actually do all that learning, you're going to be helpless.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So you do n't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself, "A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?"																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do n't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And then as adults, we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas, and we're production and marketing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups, we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring, and we're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning, that's what they're for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And in fact, the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it all depends on the ideas of this guy, the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize, describe, the way that scientists find out about the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They go out and test it against the evidence.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And some 10 years ago, I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes, I think it actually looks something like this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they're revising to figure out how the world works.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics, they look extremely stupid.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How could it be that children are doing statistics?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And using this very simple machine, my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But actually, this detector works in a bit of a strange way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector, something you would n't ever think of to begin with, the detector will actually activate two out of three times.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector, it will only activate two out of six times.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we did just this; we gave four year - olds this pattern of evidence, and we just asked them to make it go.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And sure enough, the four year - olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The first one is, again, remember, these are four year - olds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're just learning how to count.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But unconsciously, they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world, that seems very unlikely to begin with.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've show that four year - olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So in these circumstances, the children are using statistics to find out about the world, but after all, scientists also do experiments, and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When children do experiments we call it "" getting into everything "" or else "" playing. "" And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones did n't, and then she showed them an anomaly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Video) Boy: How about this?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Same as the other side.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Boy: What's making this light up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) I do n't know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this, and this needs to be like this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	AG: Okay, hypothesis two.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Boy: That's why.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oh.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) AG: Now this is his next idea.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He told the experimenter to do this, to try putting it out onto the other location.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Not working either.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oh, the bottom of this box has electricity in here, but this does n't have electricity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Boy: It's lighting up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So when you put four.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	AG: Okay, there's his fifth hypothesis.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy, but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something, what they really do is do a series of experiments.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is actually pretty typical of four year - olds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers, a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I think just the opposite is true.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And adults' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important, we should pay attention to it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid, and everything else sort of goes dark.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we even know something about the way the brain does this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains, sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible, more plastic, better at learning, and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we have a very focused, purpose - driven kind of attention.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If we look at babies and young children, we see something very different.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And if you actually look in their brains, you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity, and the inhibitory parts have n't come on yet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention, what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness, that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new, or when we're in a new city for the first time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands, so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking, talking, faculty meeting - attending zombie back home.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what's it like to be a baby?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double -espressos.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) That's a fantastic way to be, but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning. (Laughter)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now it's good to be a grownup.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I do n't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's good to be a grownup.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But if what we want is to be like those butterflies, to have open-mindedness, open learning, imagination, creativity, innovation, maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In November of 2003, I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's me with Youssou N'Dour, onstage, having the time of my life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The next day, all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island, where he was going to give a conference to the world's press, standing in front of his former prison cell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You can see the bars of the window there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In that moment in time, Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country; that post -apartheid Rainbow Nation, a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims, the most vulnerable of all, were women and children.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This was a huge impact on my mind, because I am a woman and I am a mother, and I had n't realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so I committed — when I left South Africa, when I left Capetown, I told myself, "" This is going to be something that I have to talk about.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I have to serve. "" And so, subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences, interviews, talking and using my platform as a musician, with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous, unbelievable work that he had done.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela, everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa, his country, the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there, they would be shocked.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat, the founder of Treatment Action Campaign, an incredible campaigner and activist.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I met him at a 46664 event.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV, people who are living with HIV.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt I say, "" Yes, we can talk about this issue.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It does n't have to be in the closet. "" I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women, most of whom are HIV - positive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They work in the field.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They have education programs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They bring out the issues of stigma.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's quite extraordinary what they do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And yes, my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do, and are still continuing to do in South Africa.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is my SING Campaign.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here I am in Oslo in Norway, getting a nice, fat check; singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white, middle - class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart, the whole nature, of this terrible tragedy that is taking place, that people are tending to avoid, because they are fatigued, and they really do n't quite know what the solutions are.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister, attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him, and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change, which is absolutely necessary.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is in the Scottish Parliament.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I was showing them my experiences and trying to, again, raise awareness.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And once again, in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he's the director of UNAIDS.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me, only a few months ago, to become a UNAIDS ambassador.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This can happen.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And here I am with a pregnant woman, who is HIV positive and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident, because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And her baby will receive PMTCT, which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Avelile's mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS - related illness.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Avelile had the virus, she was born with the virus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And here she is at seven years old, weighing no more than a one year - old baby.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	At this point in her life, she's suffering with full - blown AIDS and had pneumonia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we did n't know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we did n't know if she was going to survive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience, this one child, you know, that story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Five months later, we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm getting — the hairs on my — I do n't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is the transformation that took place.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Is n't it extraordinary?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, I would like to say to you, each one in the audience, if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care, and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals, specifically five and six, should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub - Saharan Africa — could you please stand up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think that's fair to say, it's almost everyone in the hall.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you very much.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union, a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The rocket was huge.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	On October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time: "" We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the olden days, explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now we have the good fortune to open up space.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy. "" You're watching snippets from "" Sputnik, "" my fifth documentary feature, which is just about completed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It tells the story of Sputnik, and the story of what happened to America as a result.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For days after the launch, Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens, it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday, the media and the politicians told us, and we believed, that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology, and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs, using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All hell broke loose.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It provoked the missile gap.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It exploded an arms race.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It began the space race.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases, and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, some here will remember this day, June 1958, the National Civil Defense Drill, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen, and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Support for engineering, math and science — education in general — boomed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA, and the Internet, and, of course, NASA.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation, into something that was overall very good for America.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	 Sputnik "" will soon be released.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors: longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'd like to thank you all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you, Chris.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Good morning. So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve, to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's new technology. You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data: names of places, monuments, buildings, maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So these are my illusion glasses.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're a little bigger. They're a prototype.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when you look through them, you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let me show you what I mean.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All right. Very significant mark.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And let's put it back into the deck, somewhere in the middle, and let's get started.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Music) Voice: System ready. Acquiring image.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Marco Tempest: For those of you who do n't play cards, a deck of cards is made up of four different suits: hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols, and have been interpreted in many different ways.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, some say that the four suits represent the four seasons.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's spring, summer, autumn and â   Voice: My favorite season is winter. MT: Well yeah, mine too.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Winter is like magic. It's a time of change, when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow, and then it all disappears.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are 13 cards in each suit. (Music) Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	MT: So over here is low tide, and over here is high tide, and in the middle is the moon.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There is the color red and the color black, representing the constant change from day to night.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that. (Laughter) MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Music) Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards, the result is 365.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	MT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year, the number of days between each birthday.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Make a wish. (Blowing noise) Voice: Do n't tell, or it wo n't come true.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards, and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls, men and women, husbands and wives, even kings and queens. (Applause) Voice: And who are these? MT: Ah, mischief - makers. Watch.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Wake up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Joker: Whoa. MT: Are you ready for your party piece?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Joker: Ready! MT: Let me see what you've got.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Joker: Presenting my pogo stick. MT: Ah. Watch out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music) MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm performing for you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Voice: Signed card detected. MT: Well, sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician? Is it a 9 - to - 5 job?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Of course not! You've got to practice 24 / 7.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I do n't literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration, but it does take practice. Now, some people will say, well, magic, that must be the work of some evil supernatural force. (Laughter) (Applause) (Music) Whoa.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, to this, I just say, no no.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Actually, in German, it's nein nein. (Laughter) Magic is n't that intense. I have to warn you, though, if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this, do n't play for money.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Music) Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	MT: Yeah, but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Voice: I think you got your birthday wish. MT: And that actually leaves me with the last, and most important card of all: the one with this very significant mark on it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And unlike anything else we've just seen, virtual or not. Voice: Signed card detected.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Digital MT: This is without a question the real thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	MT: Bye bye. (Music) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've been at MIT for 44 years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And the third is a little bit less obvious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Have they all agreed? No, not completely.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I have so much money, it takes me forever.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I grew up in Bihar, India's poorest state, and I remember when I was six years old, I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My brothers and I dug in, and that's when my father came home.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He was livid, and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half - eaten sweets was pulled away from us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Later, I understood why my father got so upset.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar, and he had developed a firm stance against corruption, even though he was harassed and threatened.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	His was a lonely struggle, because Bihar was also India's most corrupt state, where public officials were enriching themselves, [rather] than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And as I went village to village, I remember one day, when I was famished and exhausted, and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree, and just at that time, one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I resolved to give back.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Later, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My initial work focused on Uganda, where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But after we disbursed the loans, I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers, new health clinics without drugs, and the poor once again without any voice or recourse.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was Bihar all over again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Bihar represents the challenge of development: abject poverty surrounded by corruption.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Globally, 1.3 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day, and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944, when winners of World War II, 500 founding fathers, and one lonely founding mother, gathered in New Hampshire, USA, to establish the Bretton Woods institutions, including the World Bank.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that traditional approach to development had three key elements. First, transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South, accompanied by reform prescriptions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And third, the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Today, each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Open knowledge, open aid, open governance, and together, they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The first key shift is open knowledge.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S., Europe or the World Bank.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They get their inspiration, their hope, their practical know -how, from successful emerging economies in the South.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years, how Mexico's Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is the new ecosystem of open- knowledge flows, not just traveling North to South, but South to South, and even South to North, with Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And just as these North -to - South transfers are opening up, so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is the second shift: open aid.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Recently, the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years, and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Take GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya, the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located, and the darker the shade of green, the more the number of out - of - school children.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out - of - school children, provoking new questions. Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this leads me to the third, and in my view, the most significant shift in development: open governance. Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India, using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Are governments delivering services to the citizens?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So for instance, several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But, you know, there is a big difference between a budget that's public and a budget that's accessible.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	This is a public budget. (Laughter) And as you can see, it's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To tackle this problem, governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it's more understandable to the public.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In this map from Moldova, the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes, and the red color shows the opposite.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual, and what's exciting is that with this openness, there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So in the Philippines today, parents and students can give real - time feedback on a website, Checkmyschool.org, or using SMS, whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school, the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the government is responsive. So for instance, when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption, the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you know what's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South, from the Philippines to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August, 2011. But within a few weeks, university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working, aggregated in the red bubbles that you see, which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Today, even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent, accessible and responsive to the poor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But, you know, in many parts of the world, governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These are the lonely warriors like my father and many, many others, and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So for instance, today, in Ghana, courageous reformers from civil society, Parliament and government, have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector, and, galvanized by this, reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These examples give new hope, new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Two years ago, on April 8th, 2010, I called my father.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was very late at night, and at age 80, he was typing a 70 - page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Though he was no lawyer, he argued the case in court himself the next day. He won the ruling, but later that very evening, he fell, and he died.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He fought till the end, increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty, not only did government officials need to be honest, but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These became the two bookends of his life, and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Today, I'm inspired by these changes, and I'm excited that at the World Bank, we are embracing these new directions, a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions, inspiring practitioners, so aid becomes transparent, accountable and effective, so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We need to accelerate these shifts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If we do, we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar, in Uganda, and beyond.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We will find that these children, too, have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you. (Applause) (Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So now just take a minute.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They look really pretty.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Pretty yucky, you would agree with me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Actually, soap is available.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why are n't people washing their hands?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why is it that Mayank, this young boy that I met in India, is n't washing his hands?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They'll keep it away from him so he does n't waste it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Did you learn to wash your hands in school?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Think about it: Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And most importantly, win for the most vulnerable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Without it, and without talking about it, we cannot achieve the change that we need.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This one is from Myanmar.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Her son, Myo, is her second one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the most beautiful invention in public health.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I would like to show you something I've been working on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30 - day challenges.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Anyway, today I'm a writer - blogger guy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, in the animal world, that works fine.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's one box for every week of a 90 - year life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's a job for all of us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations, at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says, "" Man, why does n't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you do n't have to bathe? "" And I sat, and I was like, "" Man, I would buy that, eh? "" So I went home, and I did a little research, and I found some very shocking statistics.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa, and five million of them are in South Africa.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Various diseases thrive in this environment, the most drastic of which is called trachoma.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year. The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma, all you have to do is wash your face: no medicine, no pills, no injections.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself, "" Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that I do n't want to bathe, I at least need to do it to try to save the world. "" (Laughter) So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone — I did n't have a laptop, I did n't have Internet much, except for the 20 - rand - an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions, creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper,																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	—		a	n	d		I		w	r	o	t	e		d	o	w	n		a		l	i	t	t	l	e		f	o	r	m	u	l	a		o	n		a		p	i	e	c	e		o	f		p	a	p	e	r	,	 
0	and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now we need to get this thing into practice.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Fast forward four years later, after having written a 40 - page business plan on the cell phone, having written my patent on the cell phone, I'm the youngest patent - holder in the country, and — ("" No more bathing! "") — I ca n't say any more than that. (Laughter) I had invented DryBath, the world's first bath -substituting lotion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You literally put it on your skin, and you do n't have to bathe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had, I went to university, met a few people, got it into practice, and we have a fully functioning product that's ready to go to the market. It's actually available on the market.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One of the things we learned was that poor communities do n't buy products in bulk.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They buy products on demand. A person in Alex does n't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette each day, even though it's more expensive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	After creating that model, we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath. (Laughter) At least once a week.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath, and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas, two hours more for school, two hours more for homework, two hours more to just be a kid.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down to our key value proposition, which was cleanliness and convenience.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	DryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Having put the product into practice, we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market, and one question I have for the audience today is, on the gravel roads of Limpopo, with an allowance of 50 rand a week, I came up with a way for the world not to bathe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What's stopping you? (Applause) I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process, last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world, the first African to get that accolade, and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this just because I did n't want to bathe. Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause.)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was leaving a seminar when it started, humming to myself, fumbling with my bag just as I'd done a hundred times before, when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe, "She is leaving the room."																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	She is opening the door.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This was the beginning. The voice had arrived.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the voice persisted, days and then weeks of it, on and on, narrating everything I did in the third person.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	She is going to a lecture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was neutral, impassive and even, after a while, strangely companionate and reassuring, although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, for example, if I was angry and had to hide it, which I often did, being very adept at concealing how I really felt, then the voice would sound frustrated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	A subtle conditioning process had begun, the implication that normal people do n't hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I spent some time telling the college G.P.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And to be fair, I was desperate for interest and help, and I began to tell him about my strange commentator.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus, and during an appointment which was running very late, I said, "" I'm sorry, doctor, I've got to go.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	A hospital admission followed, the first of many, a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next, and then, worst of all, a toxic, tormenting sense of hopelessness, humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom, my fear and resistance towards it intensified.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now essentially, this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind, a kind of psychic civil war, and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You see that glass of water?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In effect, a vicious cycle of fear, avoidance, mistrust and misunderstanding had been established, and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Two years later, and the deterioration was dramatic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	By now, I had the whole frenzied repertoire: terrifying voices, grotesque visions, bizarre, intractable delusions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years, it seems to me now as if someone died in that place, and yet, someone else was saved.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A broken and haunted person began that journey, but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So for example, voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world, rather than an actual, objective danger.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I remember, for example, sitting up one night on guard outside my parents' room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was like, "" Do n't mess with me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've got a plastic fork, do n't you know? "" Strategic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	I'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice, the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement, an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher, which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy, a sane reaction to insane circumstances, not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured, but a complex, significant and meaningful experience to be explored.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This type of society is not only possible, it's already on its way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	To paraphrase Chavez, once social change begins, it can not be reversed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You can not humiliate the person who feels pride.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In this respect, for members of society, there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone, to bear witness, to reach out a hand, to share the burden of someone's suffering, and to hold the hope for their recovery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We are unique. We are irreplaceable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The light never goes out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Tell me about you. "" Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because, of course, this is a photograph that you ca n't take with your camera.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the trigger.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Photos like this: construction going on along a busy road.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What creates the illusion?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	But at the same time, we know it ca n't.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's just really about combining different realities.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the things that make a photograph look realistic, I think it's the things that we do n't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But when combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So here's another example.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The shores are from a different location.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So to achieve a realistic result, I think it comes down to planning.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It always starts with a sketch, an idea.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then it's about combining the different photographs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And here every piece is very well planned.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So all the tools are out there, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby, has, in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world's media combined.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Can that possibly be true?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Julian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a worry — is n't it? — that the rest of the world's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: How does it work?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How do people release the documents?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And how do you secure their privacy?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	JA: So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers, and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we use this state - of - the- art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails, pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We get information in the mail, the regular postal mail, encrypted or not, vet it like a regular news organization, format it — which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do, when you're talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate, but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	JA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know, and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Phone ring) God damn it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) CA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership. (Laughter)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So let's take [an] example, actually.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is something you leaked a few years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If we can have this document up...																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: So this is the Kroll Report.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He was a soft dictator of Kenya.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report, spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi, who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I went there in 2007, and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election, December 28.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When we released that report, we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki, had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out, Daniel arap Moi, so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: And — I mean, to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya, not from the official media, but indirectly, and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya, in Tanzanian and South African press.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so it came in from the outside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that, after a couple of days, made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV, shifted the vote by 10 percent, according to a Kenyan intelligence report, which changed the result of the election.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: Wow, so your leak really substantially changed the world?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Yep.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) CA: Here's — We're going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The video itself is longer, but here's a short clip.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is — this is intense material, I should warn you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Radio:... just fuckin ', once you get on' em just open'em up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along...																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You're clear. All right. Firing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Light'em all up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	C'mon, fire!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Machine gun fire) Keep shoot'n. Keep shoot 'n. (Machine gun fire) Keep shoot'n.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Hotel... Bushmaster Two - Six, Bushmaster Two - Six,																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	we need to move, time now!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Yeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Roger. I got'em.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Two -Six, this is Two - Six, we're mobile.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit'em.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: So, what was the impact of that?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: The impact on the people who worked on it was severe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right, including two Reuters employees?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees, two young children were wounded.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: And releasing this caused widespread outrage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage, do you think?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: I do n't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street, and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30 - millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And there was two journalists involved that clearly were n't insurgents because that's their full - time job.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, arrested, and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you, along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	I mean, did he?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: We have denied receiving those cables.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	He has been charged, about five days ago, with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, we had released, early in the year, a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy, but this is not necessarily connected.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: I mean, if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables...																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	JA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?) JA: Yeah. (CA: Because?) JA: Well, because these sort of things reveal what the true state of, say, Arab governments are like, the true human-rights abuses in those governments.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you look at declassified cables, that's the sort of material that's there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: So let's talk a little more broadly about this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, in general, what's your philosophy?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Well, there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world, what sort of information can achieve reform.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there's a lot of information.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing, that's a really good signal that when the information gets out, there's a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best, that know it from the inside out, are spending work to conceal it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's what we've found in practice, and that's what the history of journalism is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: But are there risks with that, either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large, where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, we have a harm immunization policy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But there are legitimate secrets — you know, your records with your doctor; that's a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well - motivated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: So they are well - motivated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what would you say to, for example, the, you know, the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military, and he says, "" You know what, you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That gives the impression, has given the impression, to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Actually, they're not. My son is n't. How dare you? "" What would you say to that?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But remember, the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan — they do n't need to see the video; they see it every day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's what they see every day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all, and that's our hope.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Light is good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But do you see any irony in the fact that, in order for you to shine that light, you have to, yourself, create secrecy around your sources?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Not really. I mean, we do n't have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do n't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Should they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us, but we're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission, not to screw it up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far — I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, hero — people's hero — bringing this important light.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Dangerous troublemaker.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Who's got the hero view?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	JA: Oh, come on. There must be some.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have to try better. Let's show them another example.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Now here's something that you have n't yet leaked, but I think for TED you are.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What is this?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania, like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, but not quite as big.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that, in fact, security guards from some rival, various competing oil firms had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it, so it was an extremely difficult document for us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We could n't verify it because we did n't know who wrote it and knew what it was about.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So under that basis, we put it out and said, "" Look, we're skeptical about this thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do n't know, but what can we do?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The material looks good, it feels right, but we just ca n't verify it. "" And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it, wanting to track down the source — (Laughter) saying, "" Hey, we want to track down the source. "" And we were like, "" Oh, tell us more.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What document is it, precisely, you're talking about?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Is it really yours? "" So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Yeah.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) That's happened quite a lot though.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is like one of our methods of identifying, of verifying, what a material is, is to try and get these guys to write letters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: Yeah. Have you had information from inside BP?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	JA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment, we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's a problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization, we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth, and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but do n't have enough people to actually process and vet this information.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: So that's the key bottleneck, basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with, so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff, and then lower security cases.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Can that be right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Well, my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult, so the combination between the two...																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) CA: I mean, a psychologist might say that's a recipe for breeding paranoia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: What, the movie business?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) (Applause) CA: And you were also — I mean, you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Well, I was a journalist.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I wrote a magazine, was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So you have to be careful with hacker.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean there's like — there's a method that can be deployed for various things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Unfortunately, at the moment, it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	So this phrase is not, not as nice as it used to be.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: Yeah, well, I certainly do n't think you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account, but what about your core values?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: I'm not sure about the incident.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But the core values: well, capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's something from my father and something from other capable, generous men that have been in my life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Yeah. And you know, I'm a combative person, so I'm not actually so big on the nurture, but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims, which is to police perpetrators of crime.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story: what happened in Iceland?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You basically published something there, ran into trouble with a bank, then the news service there was injuncted from running the story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Instead, they publicized your side.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That made you very high - profile in Iceland. What happened next?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Iceland went through this financial crisis.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was the hardest hit of any country in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Anyway, so we release this report in July last year.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air, like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk, and the news reader was like, "This has never happened before. What do we do?"																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, we just show the website instead, for all that time, as a filler, and we became very famous in Iceland, went to Iceland and spoke about this issue.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again, and as a result, working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts, we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press, with the strongest journalistic protections in the world, with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Iceland's a Nordic country, so, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And just a month ago, this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.

0	(Applause) Last question, Julian.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	When you think of the future then, do you think it's more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control, more secrecy, or us watching Big Brother, or it's just all to be played for either way?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U., between China and the United States.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's why it's a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort, we can shift it one way or the other.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	CA: Well, it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion to say, Julian, be careful, and all power to you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	JA: Thank you, Chris. (CA: Thank you.)

0	Gather my beloved near, and our chanting will be dancing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Our humming will be drumming.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I will not be played.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This heartbeat is louder than death.

1	What that means is prepping my outfit, (Laughter) prepping options, trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Poetry does that.

0	So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Hold her now with you.

0	When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s, the future of the world was bleak.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The population explosion was unstoppable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Global famine was inevitable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The acid rain was falling on the forests.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The oil was running out, and a nuclear winter would finish us off.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	None of those things happened, (Laughter) and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime, the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet, in real terms, adjusted for inflation, has tripled.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Child mortality is down by two-thirds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Per-capita food production is up by a third.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And all this at a time when the population has doubled.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How did we achieve that?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population, and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine, to meet and, indeed, to mate.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In other words, you need to understand how ideas have sex.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These are both real objects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The other is obviously a computer mouse.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I've tried to work out which is bigger, and it's almost impossible.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The differences are what interest me, because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one - and - a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Of course there were a few changes, but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There was no progress, no innovation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And there's another difference too, which is the object on the left is made from one substance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances, from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas, the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser, the idea of transistors.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They've all been combined together in this technology.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it's this combination, this cumulative technology, that intrigues me, because I think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My body's an accumulation of ideas too: the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They've come together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, it uses sexual reproduction.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures, a green one and a red one, then one has to be better than the other.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One goes extinct for the other to survive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But if you have a sexual species, then it's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not confined to its own lineage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What's the process that's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I think the answer is exchange, the habit of exchanging one thing for another.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a unique human feature.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	No other animal does it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As Adam Smith said, "" No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog. "" (Laughter) You can have culture without exchange.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You can have, as it were, asexual culture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But the difference is that these cultures never expand, never grow, never accumulate, never become combinatorial, and the reason is because there is no sex, as it were, there is no exchange of ideas.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's no exchange of ideas between them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And why does exchange raise living standards?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And here is a Stone Age version of his story, although he told it in terms of trade between countries.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He does n't need Adam.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He can make his own spears and axes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well no, because if you think about it, if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes, and then they trade, then they will each have saved an hour of work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be, because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the gains from trade are only going to grow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is one of the beauties of exchange, is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization, which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That is prosperity, the saving of time in satisfying your needs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you're on the average wage in Britain today?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the answer is about half a second.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Back in 1950, you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since 1950, as it were, because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else, or you can acquire another good or service.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And back in 1880, it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Back in 1800, you'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In other words, the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse, and ask yourself: "" Who made them and for who? "" The stone axe was made by someone for himself.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was self - sufficiency.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We call that poverty these days.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But the object on the right was made for me by other people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How many other people?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	You know, I think it's probably millions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee, which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig, who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They were all working for me, to make a mouse for me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's the way society works.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's what we've achieved as a species.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the old days, if you were rich, you literally had people working for you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's how you got to be rich; you employed them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They made his silly outfits, like this, (Laughter) and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV's pictures, he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris, and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal that's probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other's living standards.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, you do get other animals working for each other too.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But there's a big difference, which is that it only happens within the colony.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's no working for each other across the colonies.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The queen does it all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In our species, we do n't like doing that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Even in England, we do n't leave reproduction to the Queen.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) So when did this habit start?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I've got no evidence for that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In all hunter - gatherer societies today, there's a foraging division of labor between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It is n't always quite that simple, but there's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The woman knows that, in the Hadzas' case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And she does n't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the man knows that he does n't have to do any digging to get roots.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it's big enough to share some.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so both sides raise each other's standards of living through the sexual division of labor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When did this happen? We do n't know, but it's possible that Neanderthals did n't do this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They were a highly cooperative species.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They were a highly intelligent species.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine in this room today.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They were imaginative. They buried their dead.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They had language, probably, because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us, which was discovered here in Oxford.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But there's no evidence of a sexual division of labor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the other thing there's no evidence for is exchange between groups, because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains, the tools they made, are always made from local materials.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For example, in the Caucasus there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're always made from local chert.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date, 30,000 years ago, and some of those are from local chert, but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when human beings began moving objects around like this, it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Trade is 10 times as old as farming.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa, when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that will have led to specialization.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How do you know that long - distance movement means trade rather than migration?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals, who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa, which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs, and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade, not migration.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What happens when you cut people off from exchange, from the ability to exchange and specialize?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress, you can actually throw it into reverse.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	An example is Tasmania.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago, the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland, they actually experienced regress.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It did n't happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island, similar people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The reason: because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight, and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The Tasmanians were isolated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Go back to this image again and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who, but who knew how to make it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But who knows how to make a computer mouse?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Nobody, literally nobody.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean this quite seriously.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The president of the computer mouse company does n't know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He just knows how to run a company.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The person on the assembly line does n't know because he does n't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s, called "" I, Pencil "" in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made, and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil, because the people who assemble it do n't know how to mine graphite, and they do n't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what we've done in human society, through exchange and specialization, is we've created the ability to do things that we do n't even understand.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's not the same with language.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But with technology, we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And by the way, that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q., about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's completely irrelevant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas, and how well they're cooperating, not how clever the individuals are.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we've created something called the collective brain.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're just the nodes in the network.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're the neurons in this brain.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's the interchange of ideas, the meeting and mating of ideas between them, that is causing technological progress, incrementally, bit by bit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	However, bad things happen.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And in the future, as we go forward, we will, of course, experience terrible things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There will be wars; there will be depressions; there will be natural disasters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making, and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before, I'm also sure that technology will advance, and therefore living standards will advance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because through the cloud, through crowd sourcing, through the bottom - up world that we've created, where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate, we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My name is Uldus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I am a photo-based artist from Russia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My name is Amit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google, and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it took 18 months.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I'm going to focus on the demo.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There are a lot of stories about why we did this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide, and it's access.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I grew up in India.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I had a great education — I'm not complaining — but I did n't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so when I started traveling and going to these museums, I started learning a lot.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And while working at Google, I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You look around at all these museums here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA, the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Two ways of going in — very simple.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Click and, bang, you're in this museum.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It does n't matter where you are — Bombay, Mexico, it does n't really matter.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You move around, you have fun.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You want to navigate around the museum?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Open the plan up, and, in one click, jump.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Keep going. Have fun.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Explore.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) Thanks. I have n't come to the best part.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "" The Harvesters "" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I see this plus sign.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now this is one of the images.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this is all of the meta-data information.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this — but I'm going to click this off right now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I get a lot of people asking me: "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You can zoom around very simply.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You see some fun stuff happening here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I love this guy; his expression is priceless.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But then you really want to go deep.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I was like, "" Hold on. That sounds interesting. "" Went in, and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, and actually found out that this is a game called squall, which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And apparently it was quite popular.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I do n't know why they did it, but I learned something about it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now just to give you some perspective, I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here is where we were, and this is the painting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) The best is yet to come — so in a second.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, again in New York.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So another one of my favorites, "" The Starry Night. "" Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But what if you want to see brush strokes?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You zoom in. You really go in.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is "" The Starry Night, "" I think, never seen like this before.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's a lot of other stuff here, but I do n't have time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Any one of you, anybody — does n't matter if you're rich, if you're poor, if you have a fancy house — does n't matter.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Very simply, you go in — and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is "" The Ambassadors, "" based in the National Gallery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I think, in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It does n't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I probably should n't say that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It really comes from these artists.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's been my humbling experience in this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is, "" Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum? "" And the answer is no.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's to supplement the experience.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that's it. Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm a storyteller.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's what I do in life — telling stories, writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But before I go there, please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	I will do so with the help of words, of course, but also a geometrical shape, the circle, so throughout my talk, you will come across several circles.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was born in Strasbourg, France to Turkish parents.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Shortly after, my parents got separated, and I came to Turkey with my mom.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	From then on, I was raised as a single child by a single mother.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now in the early 1970s, in Ankara, that was a bit unusual.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Our neighborhood was full of large families, where fathers were the heads of households, so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	On the one hand was my mother, a well - educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	On the other hand was my grandmother, who also took care of me and was more spiritual, less educated and definitely less rational.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Many people visited my grandmother, people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Each time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic, take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then one by one, she would encircle these thorns with dark ink.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A week later, the patient would come back for a follow - up examination.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists, but the truth is, of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions, I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In response she said, "" Yes, praying is effective, but also beware of the power of circles. "" From her, I learned, amongst many other things, one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life, be it an acne, a blemish or the human soul, all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It will dry up inside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We all do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're born into a certain family, nation, class.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted, then we too run the risk of drying up inside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Our imagination might shrink; our hearts might dwindle, and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Our friends, neighbors, colleagues, family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us, it means we are surrounded with our mirror image.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Ironically, [living in] communities of the like -minded is one of the greatest dangers of today's globalized world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And it's happening everywhere, among liberals and conservatives, agnostics and believers, the rich and the poor, East and West alike.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We tend to form clusters based on similarity, and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In my opinion, one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Stories can not demolish frontiers, but they can punch holes in our mental walls.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other, and sometimes even like what we see.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I started writing fiction at the age of eight.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried about my sanity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good, except I told this to imaginary friends around me, which was not so good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was an introverted child, to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them, so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day - to - day experiences and emotions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What she did n't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring, and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Instead, I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And thus began my life - long passion for writing fiction.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So from the very beginning, fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives, other possibilities.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And please bear with me: I'll draw a circle and come back to this point.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now one other thing happened around this same time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My mother became a diplomat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So from this small, superstitious, middle - class neighborhood of my grandmother, I was zoomed into this posh, international school [in Madrid], where I was the only Turk.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the "" representative foreigner. "" In our classroom, there were children from all nationalities, yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan, egalitarian classroom democracy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Instead, it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own, but as the representative of something larger.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We were like a miniature United Nations, which was fun, except whenever something negative, with regards to a nation or a religion, took place.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The child who represented it was mocked, ridiculed and bullied endlessly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I should know, because during the time I attended that school, a military takeover happened in my country, a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope, and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The other children asked me about the movie "" Midnight Express, "" which I had not seen; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked, because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers, and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country: politics, cigarettes and the veil.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany and Ankara again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Everywhere I went, I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Stories gave me a sense of center, continuity and coherence, the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul, the city I adore.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When I ran out of the building at three in the morning, I saw something that stopped me in my tracks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There was the local grocer there — a grumpy, old man who did n't sell alcohol and did n't speak to marginals.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her, and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the face of death and destruction, our mundane differences evaporated, and we all became one even if for a few hours.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake, but when we are reading a good novel, we leave our small, cozy apartments behind, go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Shortly after, I went to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift, as a linguistic one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I started writing fiction in English.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile — they ask me why I do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I love writing in Turkish, which to me is very poetic and very emotional, and I love writing in English, which to me is very mathematical and cerebral.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I feel connected to each language in a different way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For me, like millions of other people around the world today, English is an acquired language.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When you're a latecomer to a language, what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know, crack better jokes, say better things, but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And that gap is very intimidating.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But if we manage not to be frightened by it, it's also stimulating.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimulating.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	At this stage, my grandmother, who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety, started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And because God loves her, I did get married.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) But instead of settling down, I went to Arizona.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And since my husband is in Istanbul, I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that could n't be more different.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I guess one part of me has always been a nomad, physically and spiritually.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Stories accompany me, keeping my pieces and memories together, like an existential glue.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Yet as much as I love stories, recently, I've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is a subject that I would love to think about together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When my first novel written in English came out in America, I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I liked your book, he said, "but I wish you had written it differently."																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) I asked him what he meant by that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He said, "" Well, look at it. There's so many Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it, but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man. "" Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston, so to me, it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters, but I understood what my critic was looking for.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Many authors feel this pressure, but non - Western authors feel it more heavily.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me, then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and, preferably, the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You're expected to write informative, poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant - garde to your Western colleagues.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own, but as the representatives of their respective cultures: a few authors from China, a few from Turkey, a few from Nigeria.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're all thought to have something very distinctive, if not peculiar.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer, Baldwin stopped and said, "" But do n't you see? There's nothing in me that is not in everybody else, and nothing in everybody else that is not in me. "" When identity politics tries to put labels on us, it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I never forget my first multicultural reading, in Harvard Square about 10 years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We were three writers, one from the Philippines, one Turkish and one Indonesian — like a joke, you know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was only because of our passports.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories, not so much the imaginary.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A function is attributed to fiction.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In this way, not only the writers themselves, but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It comes from everywhere.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I had intended to write a constructive, multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Some people criticized, others praised me for writing about the Turkish - Armenian conflict.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was just a story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And when I say, "" just a story, "" I'm not trying to belittle my work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is, not as a means to an end.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Writers are entitled to their political opinions, and there are good political novels out there, but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Chekhov said, "" The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And only the latter is an artist's responsibility. "" Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One is interested in sweeping generalizations.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	The other, in nuances.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One draws boundaries.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The other recognizes no frontiers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Identity politics is made of solid bricks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Fiction is flowing water.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "" meddah. "" They would go to coffee houses, where they would tell a story in front of an audience, often improvising.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	With each new person in the story, the meddah would change his voice, impersonating that character.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Everybody could go and listen, you know — ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Stories cut across all boundaries, like "" The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja, "" which were very popular throughout the Middle East, North Africa, the Balkans and Asia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Today, stories continue to transcend borders.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk, they usually do n't listen to each other, but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author, and vice versa, connecting and empathizing with the narrator.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Literature has to take us beyond.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If it can not take us there, it is not good literature.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Books have saved the introverted, timid child that I was — that I once was.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But I'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When the poet and mystic, Rumi, met his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz, one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi's books into water and watch the letters dissolve.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The Sufis say, "" Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance. "" The problem with today's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other, or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves: it makes us elitist, distant and disconnected.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's a metaphor which I love: living like a drawing compass.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Meanwhile, the other leg draws a wide circle, constantly moving.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Like that, my fiction as well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	One part of it is rooted in Istanbul, with strong Turkish roots, but the other part travels the world, connecting to different cultures.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In that sense, I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal, both from here and everywhere.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace, which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than 400 years.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the palace, just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines, there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's between buildings.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm intrigued by this concept.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn, who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I like it when my characters surprise me.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel, and perhaps it will be a very happy story, and in my next book, I might write about a handsome, gay professor in Norway.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As long as it comes from our hearts, we can write about anything and everything.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Audre Lorde once said, "" The white fathers taught us to say, 'I think, therefore I am.' "" She suggested, "" I feel, therefore I am free. "" I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And yet, why is it that, in creative writing courses today, the very first thing we teach students is "" write what you know ""?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes, drawing circles beyond circles.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They connect all humanity, regardless of identity politics, and that is the good news.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem: "" Come, let us be friends for once; let us make life easy on us; let us be lovers and loved ones; the earth shall be left to no one. "" Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do achieve more in game worlds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Five million people use it every month.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's the problem that I'm trying to solve.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	His work is brilliant.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But it is not, by any means, an optimal situation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We have to start making the real world work more like a game.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Before we had awesome game controllers, we had sheep's knuckles.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	People were suffering. People were fighting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is really exciting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	According to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine was n't getting better, so the king decided they would play one final dice game.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We want to imagine epic wins, and then give people the means to achieve the epic win.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We made this game in 2007.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up in skills like local insight, knowledge networking, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The "" Dirty Jobs "" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's only a couple dozen square miles. It's in the Rockies.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And the job in question was sheep rancher.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My role on the show, for those of you who have n't seen it — it's pretty simple.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people, for one day in their life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The job in question: herding sheep. Great.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, normally, I never do any research at all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But, this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel, and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do, and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I called the Humane Society and I say, "" Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs, Can you tell me the deal? "" And they're like, "" Yeah, it's pretty straightforward. "" They use a band — basically a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday, but it had a certain familiarity to it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I said, "" Well, what exactly is the process? "" And they said, "" The band is applied to the tail, tightly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Blood flow is slowly retarded; a week later the parts in question fall off.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Great — got it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this — they confirm it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I also call PETA, just for fun, and they do n't like it — but they confirm it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	OK, that's basically how you do it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So the next day I go out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built, and we go about the business of animal husbandry.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Melanie is the wife of Albert.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Albert is the shepherd in question.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Melanie picks up the lamb — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Alright. Great.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I always watch the process done the first time before I try it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Being an apprentice, you know, you do that.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very — it was, it was impressive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb, and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now you think you know what's coming, Michael — you do n't, OK?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder, and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward, and then his head dips down, obscuring my view, but what I hear is a slurping sound, and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Can we roll the video?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	No I'm kidding — we do n't — (Laughter) I thought it best to talk in pictures.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, I do something now I've never ever done on a "" Dirty Jobs "" shoot, ever.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I say, "" Time out. Stop. "" You guys know the show, we use take one, we do n't do take two.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We do n't fool around, we do n't rehearse — we shoot what we get!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I said, "" Stop. This is nuts. "" I mean, you know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) "" This is crazy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We ca n't do this. "" And Albert's like, "" What? "" And I'm like, "" I do n't know what just happened, but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it. "" And he said "" Well, that's how we do it. "" And I said, "" Why would you do it this way? "" And before I even let him explain, I said, "" I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands. "" And he says, "" Like the Humane Society? "" And I said, "" Yes, like the Humane Society.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Let's do something that does n't make the lamb squeal and bleed — we're on in five continents, dude.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we ca n't do this. "" He says, "" OK. "" He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post, band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Lamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down, gets up, shakes a little, takes another couple steps, falls down.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Gets up, walks to the corner, it's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm looking at the lamb and I say, "" Albert, how long?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When does he get up? "" He's like, "" A day. "" I said, "" A day! How long does it take them to fall off? "" "A week."																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was, in that second.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done, and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen, and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno, and I'm like... (Laughter) Melanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Albert hands me the knife.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I go in, tail comes off.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Albert instructs, "" Push it way up there. "" I do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Push it further.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	I do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The testicles emerge — they look like thumbs, coming right at you — and he says, "" Bite'em.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Just bite'em off. "" And I heard him, I heard all the words.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) Like, how did — how did I get here?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) It's just — it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own: and suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rockies, and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) And I'm like, "" What is this jacked - up metaphor?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I do n't like what I'm thinking right now. "" And I ca n't get this thought out of my head, and I ca n't get that vision out of my sight, so I did what I had to do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I went in and I took them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I took them like this, and I yanked my face back.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) And now I ca n't get — I ca n't shake the metaphor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	OK, I'm still in "" Poetics, "" in Aristotle, and I'm thinking — out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head that I have n't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Anagnorisis and peripeteia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's what our network does; it's what "" Dirty Jobs "" is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Great.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The other word, peripeteia, that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know — Euripides and Sophocles — the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's peripety or peripeteia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this metaphor in my head — I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) I got to tell you, it's such a great device though.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When you start to look for peripetia, you find it everywhere.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, Bruce Willis in "" The Sixth Sense, "" right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people, and then, boom — "" Oh, I'm dead "" — peripetia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You know?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Neo in "" The Matrix, "" you know?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	 Oh, I'm living in a computer program "" — that's weird.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations; and I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time, but that one — that one drilled something home in a way that I just was n't prepared for.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And, as I stood there, looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled — but it looked OK.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on, and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way, what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	Because, look, I'm not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I talk to him.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) And he says, "" Hey Mike.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Look, I do n't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not, but do you realize you've shot in every state?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing, you've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right? "" I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye, dribbling down her chin, with the steel workers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	 And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively, it might be time to think about it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Because, dude, you know, four years. "" You know, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin, thoughts are bouncing around.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And, after that shoot, Dirty Jobs really did n't change, in terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And now, when I talk about the show, I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong, some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct, and they're not.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	People with dirty jobs are happier than you think.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As a group, they're the happiest people I know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I do n't want to start whistling "" Look for the Union Label, "" and all that happy worker crap.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Roadkill picker - uppers whistle while they work. I swear to God — I did it with them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I see it over and over and over again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Follow your passion — we've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Probably the worst advice I ever got.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) You know, follow your dreams and go broke, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, that's all I heard growing up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I did n't know what to do with my life, but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I can give you 30 examples, right now — Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why? Because there's so much protein in the stuff we do n't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he is one rich pig farmer, and he is good for the environment, and he spends his days doing this incredible service, and he smells like hell, but God bless him.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He's making a great living.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You ask him, "" Did you follow your passion here? "" and he'd laugh at you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The guy's worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down, outside of Vegas.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He did n't follow his passion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I hear that story over and over.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Matt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut, who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk, if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, he's selling them to Walmart.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Follow his passion? The guy's — come on.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I started to look at passion, I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness — as Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I started to look at teamwork and determination, and basically all those platitudes they call "" successories "" that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That stuff — it's suddenly all been turned on its head.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Safety — safety first?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Going back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society: what if OSHA got it wrong?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean — this is heresy, what I'm about to say — but what if it's really safety third?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) No, I mean really.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with, but the ones who really get it done, they're not out there talking about safety first.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first, the business of getting it done.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea, I was on a crab boat with the "" Deadliest Catch "" guys — which I also work on — in the first season.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're about 100 miles off the coast of Russia: 50 - foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen, and I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, I'm 40 feet off the deck, which is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know, and it's doing this in the ocean.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Unspeakably dangerous.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse and I say, with some level of incredulity, "Captain, OSHA."																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And he says, "" OSHA? Ocean. "" And he points out there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) But in that moment, what he said next ca n't be repeated in the lower 48.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It ca n't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But he looked at me, and he said, "" Son "" — he's my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that — he says, "" Son, I'm a captain of a crab boat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My responsibility is not to get you home alive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My responsibility is to get you home rich. "" (Laughter) You want to get home alive, that's on you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And for the rest of that day, safety first.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was like — So, the idea that we create this false — this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility as though it's our own, and vice versa.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Anyhow, a whole lot of things.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But, what it all comes down to is this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It goes like this — we've declared war on work, as a society, all of us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a civil war.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a cold war, really.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We did n't set out to do it and we did n't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way, but we've done it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we've waged this war on at least four fronts, certainly in Hollywood.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The way we portray working people on TV — it's laughable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds and he's got a giant butt crack. Admit it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You see him all the time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's what plumbers look like, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That's what TV does.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We try hard on "" Dirty Jobs "" not to do that, which is why I do the work and I do n't cheat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I mean, so many of the commercials that come out there — in the way of a message, what's really being said?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Your life would be better if you could work a little less, if you did n't have to work so hard, if you could get home a little earlier, if you could retire a little faster, if you could punch out a little sooner — it's all in there, over and over, again and again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Washington? I ca n't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I do n't really know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I just know that that's a front in this war.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And right here guys, Silicon Valley, I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How many people have their Blackberries?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We're plugged in; we're connected.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Good grief, not to this crowd.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And nobody celebrates imitation the way "" Dirty Jobs "" guys know it has to be done.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Your iPhone without those people making the same interface, the same circuitry, the same board, over and over?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	All of that? That's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, we've got this new toolbox, you know.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Our tools today do n't look like shovels and picks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They look like the stuff we walk around with.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	And I realized, probably too late in this game — I hope not, because I do n't know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we're going to do as many as we can.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with, is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things, not just the testicles on my chin.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I got a lot wrong.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, we're thinking — by we, I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work, manual labor, skilled labor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm talking about grandfather stuff, the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of — you know, kind of lost a little.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The infrastructure is a huge deal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This war on work, that I suppose exists, has casualties like any other war.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The infrastructure's the first one; declining trade - school enrollments are the second one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Every single year: fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers, fewer welders, fewer pipefitters, fewer steamfitters.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline, over and over.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Meanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars — at a minimum, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers — that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure, which is currently rated at a D minus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	So, if I were running for anything, and I'm not, I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create are n't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us, but I also know that clean and dirty are n't opposites.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They're two sides of the same coin, just like innovation and imitation, like risk and responsibility, like peripetia and anagnorisis, like that poor little lamb, who I hope is n't quivering anymore, and like my time that's gone.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's been great talking to you and get back to work, will you?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I felt like saying to him — but I did n't say it — I felt like saying, "" You know what?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting. "" (Laughter) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one- upmanship.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So a high I.Q.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper - connected 24 / 7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven- and - a- half - or eight - hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us, to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How does this happen?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So you can then map function onto structure, and then find out what the circuitry's doing to generate that particular function.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So that's what we're trying to do.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You ca n't even recognize yourself in the mirror.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When you're a little baby, a young baby, you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	She's some other woman. She's an impostor. "" It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, you try using the Freudian explanation there.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans, or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, what's really going on?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, to explain this curious disorder, we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I talked about that earlier.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important, the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Your heart starts beating faster.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This ca n't be my mother.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then, she approaches him after an hour, he says, "" Who are you?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	You look just like my mother. "" OK?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And you all know what a phantom limb is.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	In fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It'll pat his brother on the shoulder, it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But however, about half the patients, this does n't happen.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The phantom limb — they'll say, "" But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was, these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs, the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And this is a serious clinical problem.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Patients become depressed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, how do you treat this syndrome?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	When I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm, and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut, and the actual arm had been paralyzed, and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation, and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why does this happen?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How do you do that? Well, virtual reality.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But that costs millions of dollars.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He had his arm amputated 10 years ago.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he could n't move it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, I said, "" Move your normal hand and phantom. "" He said, "" Oh, I ca n't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful. "" I said, "" Move your normal hand. "" And he says, "" Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I do n't believe this!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oh, nothing. It's clenched again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	OK, open your eyes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Bear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why would that be?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Why would there be crossed wires in some people?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	That gives you the clue.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And if it's between number and color, you get number - color synesthesia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	If it's between tone and color, you get tone - color synesthesia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So far, so good.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	OK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The last demonstration — can I take one minute?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Here, you've got Martian alphabet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Bouba? Raise your hands.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Ninety - nine percent of you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now, none of you is a Martian. How did you do that?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So, this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This story is about taking imagination seriously.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Fourteen years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Today, I'm using it to create permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms the scale of hard - edged buildings in cities around the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was an unlikely person to be doing this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I never studied sculpture, engineering or architecture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	In fact, after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I went off on my own to become an artist, and I painted for 10 years, when I was offered a Fulbright to India.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Promising to give exhibitions of paintings, I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
1	The deadline for the show arrived — my paints did n't.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I had to do something.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This fishing village was famous for sculpture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I tried bronze casting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I went for a walk on the beach, watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'd seen it every day, but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture, a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It's a self - portrait titled "" Wide Hips. "" (Laughter) We hoisted them on poles to photograph.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I was mesmerized.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans, next in Lithuania with lace makers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I liked the fine detail it gave my work, but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Returning to India to work with those fishermen, we made a net of a million and a half hand - tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thousands of people saw it, and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola - Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto, Portugal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I did n't know if I could do that and preserve my art.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Durable, engineered, permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	For two years, I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays, salt, air, pollution, and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we raised this 45,000 - pound steel ring.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I could n't build this the way I knew because hand - tied knots were n't going to withstand a hurricane.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory, learned the variables of their machines, and figured out a way to make lace with them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There was no language to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we had to create one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Three years and two children later, we raised this 50,000 - square - foot lace net.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built, permanent and had lost nothing in translation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) This intersection had been bland and anonymous.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now it had a sense of place.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I walked underneath it for the first time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	As I watched the wind's choreography unfold, I felt sheltered and, at the same time, connected to limitless sky.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My life was not going to be the same.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Historic Philadelphia City Hall: its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing, discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Next challenge, the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked, could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Laughter) I did n't know where to begin, but I said yes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates, sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I contacted NOAA, and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami, and translated it into this.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Its title: "" 1.26 "" refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth's day was shortened.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I could n't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Its shape was too complex now.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So I replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The sculpture could now be entirely soft, which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	So we had to create it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	They do n't have funding yet, but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Fourteen years ago, I searched for beauty in the traditional things, in craft forms.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous, billowing forms the scale of buildings.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	My artistic horizons continue to grow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I'll leave you with this story.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	An attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art, never visited the local art museum, dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	There they were in their business suits, laying in the grass, noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they did n't know, sharing the rediscovery of wonder.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Thank you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	After puberty, we fall off the map.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	She's a six - monther.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	(Applause)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And our left hemisphere thinks in language.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And all I could detect was this energy — energy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I'm asking myself, "" What is wrong with me?																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									
0	And I felt lighter in my body.
